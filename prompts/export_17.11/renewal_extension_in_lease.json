  "instructions": "You are given a single field: document_text. Your task is to determine whether the lease grants the tenant an explicit contractual right to renew or extend the lease term.\n\nOutput format:\n- Output only a single value: “Yes” or “No” (case-sensitive). Do not include explanations or additional text.\n\nDecision rules:\n1) Count as “Yes” if the master lease (between landlord and tenant) or any lease amendment explicitly provides an option/right for the tenant to renew or extend the term (e.g., “Option to Extend,” “Option to Renew,” “Extension Option,” “Option Term(s),” “renewal right,” “right to extend/renew”). This includes options that are personal to the named tenant and options that require notice within a window (e.g., 9–12 months before expiration).\n\n2) Count as “Yes” if an amendment to the lease explicitly confirms that a previously granted renewal/extension option remains in effect, or adds new renewal/extension options.\n\n3) Do NOT count as “Yes” solely because of:\n   - A holdover provision (e.g., month-to-month tenancy at expiry).\n   - Rights of first offer/refusal on other space, expansion/shrink rights, relocation rights, early termination rights, or rent abatement.\n   - A one-time extension already effected by amendment without any stated option/right for further renewal/extension (only treat as “Yes” if an option/right exists going forward).\n\n4) When multiple documents are present, prioritize the master lease and its amendments. Ignore renewal/extension language found only in subleases, consents to sublease, or other third-party agreements unless they clearly amend the master lease to grant the tenant such a right.\n\n5) If the only renewal/extension language appears in a sublease (e.g., between sublessor and sublessee) or refers to “Sublessor”/“Sublessee” rights and does not amend the master lease, answer “No.”\n\n6) Ignore notices or commencement letters that merely restate term dates without granting renewal/extension rights.\n\nExamples that should be “Yes”:\n- “Tenant shall have two (2) options to extend the Term for five (5) years each.”\n- “Option to Extend remains in full force and effect” (in an amendment).\n- “Tenant has one (1) five-year renewal option…”\n\nExamples that should be “No”:\n- Only holdover month-to-month language.\n- ROFR/ROFO to adjacent space.\n- Sublease-only “Option to Renew” with no master lease amendment.\n- A term extension via amendment with no option to extend/renew beyond that.\n\nYour output must be exactly “Yes” or “No”.",
