  "instructions": "You are given a single input field:\n- document_text: the full text content of one or more documents (often concatenated) related to a commercial lease file.\n\nYour task: Produce a single output field:\n- guaranty (BOOLEAN): “Yes” if the lease deal includes a guaranty (i.e., there is/are guarantor(s) guaranteeing the tenant’s obligations), otherwise “No”.\n\nOutput format:\n- Return only the single field value for guaranty: exactly “Yes” or “No”. No other text.\n\nDecision logic (apply in order, and be conservative with “Yes”):\n\n1) Explicit, executed guaranty evidence (required for “Yes”):\n   Mark guaranty = Yes only if at least one of the following is present:\n   - The lease’s Basic Provisions/Guarantor field explicitly lists one or more named guarantors (e.g., “Guarantor: John Doe”).\n   - There is a standalone, executed guaranty document (e.g., titled “Guaranty,” “Guaranty of Lease,” “Guarantee of Lease”) signed by a person/entity.\n   - The lease includes a completed and signed “Guarantor” signature block (e.g., a “Guarantor” section or page with the guarantor’s name/title/signature).\n   - An exhibit expressly titled “Guaranty” is included in the document set and is executed by the guarantor.\n\n   Important: Do NOT infer a guaranty merely from boilerplate template references to “Guarantor” (e.g., AIR CRE forms often include paragraphs about guarantors “if any”) or generic clauses like “any Guarantor” in default/estoppel sections. Such template language does not, by itself, establish a guaranty. Likewise, a mere mention of an “Exhibit [Guaranty]” in an exhibit list without the actual executed exhibit is not sufficient.\n\n2) Explicit “No guarantor” statements:\n   - If the lease shows “Guarantor: N/A,” “None,” is blank in the Guarantor field, or otherwise clearly states there is no guarantor, then guaranty = No (even if other documents contain boilerplate guarantor language).\n\n3) OFAC/BIS/watchlist screenings:\n   - If screenings are present only for the corporate tenant (e.g., “Acme, Inc.”) with no individuals and there is no other guaranty evidence → typically guaranty = No.\n   - If screenings include one or more individual persons’ names associated with a small/local business tenant (e.g., individuals at the tenant’s address) and/or include both an LLC/business name and multiple individual names tied to the same premises → you may infer personal guarantors are being vetted → guaranty = Yes, unless contradicted by an explicit “no guarantor” field in the lease.\n\n4) Ancillary brand/SPV context (use cautiously):\n   - If ancillary lease documents clearly state or include an executed parent/affiliate “Guaranty” for a single-purpose/location subsidiary tenant (e.g., “Brand X of [State], LLC” with a signed parent guaranty), then guaranty = Yes.\n   - If the tenant is a large public company leasing in its own name and there is no guaranty language or individuals being screened → typically guaranty = No.\n   - Do NOT infer a corporate/parent guaranty solely from the tenant’s name or corporate structure. Require an executed guaranty or clearly named guarantor.\n\n5) Ambiguity resolution:\n   - If evidence is mixed or incomplete and no lease page explicitly says “Guarantor: N/A,” lean as follows:\n     • Individuals screened alongside a small/local tenant, suggesting personal guarantors → lean Yes.\n     • Only the company is screened, no guaranty mentions beyond boilerplate, and no executed guaranty exhibit/signature → lean No.\n\nWhat to look for (and how to treat it):\n- “Guarantor,” “Guaranty,” “Guarantee,” “Guaranty of Lease,” “personal guaranty,” “the obligations of Lessee are guaranteed by…”\n- Basic Provisions section listing “Guarantor:” followed by an actual name → Yes.\n- Signature blocks labeled “Guarantor” that are completed and signed → Yes.\n- Standalone guaranty documents in the set that are signed → Yes.\n- AIR CRE/AIR forms often include template clauses (e.g., paragraphs 36/37 “Guarantor (if any)”) and exhibit references; these are boilerplate and do NOT imply a guaranty unless the guarantor is actually named and the guaranty is executed.\n- Exhibit lists that mention a “Guaranty” but no executed guaranty included → No.\n\nStrictly follow:\n- Boilerplate mentions of a “Guarantor” or a generic “Guaranty” paragraph without a named/signing guarantor does NOT satisfy the requirement for “Yes.”\n- Return exactly “Yes” or “No”.",
