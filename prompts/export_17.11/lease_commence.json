  "instructions": "Task: Extract and return only the Lease Commencement Date as an ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) from a block of document text that may contain one or more lease-related documents (e.g., original lease, amendments, lease modification agreements, cover letters, emails, exhibits).\n\nWhat to return:\n- Exactly one date string in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- No labels, no extra text, no punctuation.\n\nCore rules:\n1) Target the Lease Commencement Date only.\n- Do not return rent commencement dates, amendment effective dates, execution/signature dates, or “as of” dates unless the document explicitly defines them as the lease “Commencement Date” or “the date the Term shall commence.”\n\n2) Highest-priority signals to find:\n- “Commencement Date”\n- “Lease Commencement Date”\n- “The Term shall commence on [Date]”\n- “Lease Term shall commence on [Date]”\n- “The Term shall commence on [Date]”\n- “commencing on [Date]” when clearly tied to the start of the Term\n- For licenses/space usage agreements, clauses like “for the period beginning [Date] (“Commencement Date”)” count.\n\n3) Multiple documents in one input:\n- Identify the main/original lease for the premises (often titled LEASE, SHOPPING CENTER LEASE, OFFICE LEASE, STANDARD FORM LEASE, etc.). Use the original lease’s commencement if present.\n- If the document is an amendment/modification/extension, use recitals or references in it to locate the original lease and its commencement. Prefer the original lease commencement over any amendment “effective date.”\n- Do not use an amendment’s “effective date” or “retroactively effective” date as the lease commencement unless the amendment clearly states it is a new lease with a new “Commencement Date.”\n\n4) When the Commencement Date is defined by triggers, compute it if possible:\n- Many leases define Commencement as the earliest of several events (e.g., opening for business, substantial completion, delivery/possession) or a stated outside date (e.g., “(d) June 1, 2025”).\n- If the document provides a fixed outside date option among the triggers and there is no explicit evidence any earlier trigger occurred, return the stated outside date.\n- If a trigger is a computable relative date (e.g., “150 days after the Possession Date”), and the Possession Date is itself defined by a computable event in the document (e.g., “within one business day after full execution” + execution/signature dates are shown), compute it:\n  - Treat “days” as calendar days unless the text explicitly says “business days.”\n  - For “next business day” offsets, skip weekends (Mon–Fri as business days; ignore holidays).\n  - Then apply the stated day count to arrive at the Commencement Date.\n- Do not infer earlier triggers (e.g., opening for business) without explicit in-document evidence of the actual date.\n\n5) “Expected” or “projected” dates:\n- If the lease defines the Commencement Date as the date of delivery/possession and also states a specific “currently expected to occur on [Date]” for that event, and no other evidence is provided, return that stated expected date as the best available explicit Commencement Date.\n\n6) Distinguish similar dates (do NOT confuse):\n- Rent Commencement Date / free rent periods: not the lease commencement (unless the lease explicitly states they are the same and labels the lease Commencement accordingly).\n- Effective date of an amendment, LMA, or modification: not the original lease commencement date.\n- Execution/signature/“as of” date: not the commencement unless the lease text explicitly says the Term commences on that same date or unless needed solely to compute a defined trigger.\n- “Retroactively commencing [Date]” for an extension is the extended term’s start, not the original commencement. Use original commencement unless the document is a brand-new lease.\n\n7) Fallback (only if absolutely no explicit or computable commencement is available):\n- If no explicit date, no stated fallback/outside date, and no date can be computed from defined triggers, return the first day of the month following the final execution date (i.e., when all parties signed). Example: fully executed in April 2024 → return 2024-05-01.\n\n8) Practical extraction tips:\n- Scan “Basic Lease Information,” “Key Terms,” Definitions, “Term/Commencement” (often Section 1.2/1.3), and any definition of “Commencement Date.”\n- Check exhibits like a “Memorandum of Lease Commencement Date,” but ignore templates with blanks.\n- For licenses/space usage agreements, language like “period beginning [Date] (‘Commencement Date’)” is controlling.\n- If multiple commencement references appear, prefer:\n  a) A direct statement like “The Term shall commence on [Month Day, Year]” or “Commencement Date: [Date]” in the main lease body or basic information.\n  b) An explicit recital referencing the original commencement date in an amendment.\n\n9) Output constraints:\n- Return only one ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD). No other content.\n\nExamples alignment:\n- “The Term shall commence on April 1, 2015.” → 2015-04-01.\n- Commencement defined as the earliest of triggers or “(d) June 1, 2025,” with no evidence of earlier triggers → 2025-06-01.\n- Commencement defined as “the earlier of (i) Tenant opening or (ii) 150 days after the Possession Date,” and Possession Date = one business day after full execution (latest signature present): compute one business day after later signature date, then add 150 calendar days; return that date.\n- If the lease gives “Commencement Date shall mean date Landlord delivers possession (currently expected to occur on September 1, 2025)” and nothing else → 2025-09-01.\n\nDo not:\n- Do not return Rent Commencement, amendment “effective,” or signature dates unless they are explicitly the lease Commencement.\n- Do not invent earlier triggers or use external evidence.\n- Do not output explanations.\n\nFinal check order:\n1) Any explicit Commencement Date in main lease text or Basic Lease Info.\n2) Computed date from defined triggers (including outside dates and formulas).\n3) Explicit date referenced in amendment/recitals for the original lease.\n4) Expected/targeted commencement date stated for delivery/possession if no better evidence.\n5) Fallback (first day of month after final execution) only if nothing above is available.\n\nReturn only the date in YYYY-MM-DD.",
