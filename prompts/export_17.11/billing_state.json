  "instructions": "You are given document_text that may include one or more lease-related documents (e.g., original lease, amendments, commencement date agreements, option letters, lease profiles, OFAC checks) within a “Context”. Your task is to extract and return billing_state as a single U.S. state name string.\n\nAuthoritative definition (use this order of precedence):\n1) Tenant’s primary mailing/notices address state.\n2) Only if NO Tenant mailing/notices/primary address appears anywhere in the provided documents, use the Tenant’s jurisdiction of formation (state of incorporation/organization).\n\nHow to locate the correct address (priority, with disambiguation guidance):\n- Look first for dedicated notices or mailing sections explicitly tied to the Tenant, such as:\n  - “Tenant’s Address”, “Notices to Tenant”, “with its mailing address for notices at …”, “Mail to (Tenant)”, “Tenant’s Address for Notices”, “Bill To/Name & Bill To”, or similar.\n  - A Tenant address beneath the Tenant signature block (e.g., “Address:” under “TENANT:”).\n  - A clearly labeled “Tenant HQ/Corporate Address”.\n  - Lease management system “Lease Profile” pages where “Tenant”, “Name/Bill To”, or “Billing” fields list Tenant addresses.\n- If the current document is an amendment, commencement date agreement, or other modification that updates the Tenant’s notices/mailing address, use the most recent/currently effective Tenant notices address in that document (or the latest document in the provided context).\n- If the notices section distinguishes timing (e.g., “from and after the Lease Commencement Date”), treat the “from and after” address as the current/operative Tenant notices address during the Term.\n- When multiple Tenant notices addresses are listed:\n  - Exclude any “copy to”, “cc”, or “with a copy to” addresses as secondary; choose the primary, non-copy address.\n  - Prefer the address that is explicitly identified as the Tenant’s notices address in effect during the Term (e.g., “from and after the Lease Commencement Date”), even if a headquarters address is also listed for copy.\n  - If one address is identified for a Branch/Branch Manager (often at or near the Premises) and another is HQ/General Counsel/CFO, choose the Branch/operational address when it is designated as a notices address (especially when HQ is a “copy to”).\n  - If multiple true “primary” notices addresses are listed without a “copy” designation, prefer the first-listed primary address unless later text clearly re-assigns primacy (e.g., “from and after” language).\n- Do not use the property/premises address by default unless it is explicitly designated as a Tenant notices/mailing/address or as the Tenant’s primary address in the documents (e.g., “Notices to Tenant: [Premises address]”).\n- If no notices address appears in the lease/amendments/commencement documents, you may rely on other clearly related lease package artifacts in the provided context that specify the Tenant’s address (e.g., an OFAC/OFAC-SSI/State Dept screening or lease system profile included in the same context). Only use these if the lease documents do not provide any Tenant mailing/notices address.\n- If truly no Tenant address is found anywhere, then use the Tenant’s formation state (e.g., “a Delaware limited liability company” → Delaware).\n\nCritical exclusions:\n- Do NOT use the Landlord’s address or state, notary/jurisdiction stamps, bank/wire instructions, attorney addresses, or guarantor addresses.\n- Do NOT use the Premises/property location unless it is explicitly designated as the Tenant’s notices/mailing address or is the only Tenant address provided.\n- If multiple tenants are named and nothing else instructs otherwise, select the first Tenant’s notices address state that appears in the party intro, notices section, or signature block.\n\nRecency and amendments:\n- If an amendment, commencement date notice, or later document restates or changes the Tenant notices address, use the most recent/currently effective one.\n- Phrases like “from and after the Lease Commencement Date” indicate an updated operational notices address; prioritize that over earlier HQ addresses (especially where HQ is listed as “copy to”).\n\nNormalization and output:\n- Return only the full U.S. state name (e.g., “California”, “New York”, “Florida”) with no extra characters.\n- Map postal abbreviations to full names (CA → California, IL → Illinois, FL → Florida, NY → New York, etc.).\n\nEdge cases and hints:\n- If the Tenant address appears outside the U.S. and no U.S. state is present, and no U.S. formation state is available, return the best U.S. state match if clearly indicated; otherwise fall back to the formation state if available.\n- Lease management “Lease Profile” pages often include “Name/Bill To”/Billing addresses; these count as Tenant “mailing/notices” addresses for this task.\n- Ancillary screenings (e.g., OFAC/SSI) included alongside the lease packet can be used only if the lease documents do not supply any Tenant address.\n- Indicators of primary vs. secondary addresses:\n  - “with a copy to”, “cc” = secondary (exclude for state selection).\n  - “Attn: Branch Manager”, operational/branch address = often the primary notices address during the Term.\n  - “Attn: General Counsel”, “Attn: CFO” at HQ is often a copy or secondary address when a branch notices address is also provided.\n\nExamples aligned to these rules:\n- If Notices lists “Tenant: [HQ Address, Chicago, IL]” and also states “In addition, from and after the Lease Commencement Date: [Branch Address, West Palm Beach, FL] … with a copy of all notices to [HQ, Chicago, IL]”, then billing_state = “Florida” (Branch is primary notices; HQ is copy).\n- “CV Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation” with Tenant signature block address “San Diego, CA” → “California”.\n- “DB Real Estate Assets I LLC … with its mailing address … Canton, MA 02021” → “Massachusetts”.\n- If no Tenant address exists anywhere but Tenant is “a California corporation” → “California”.\n\nReturn only the state name.",
