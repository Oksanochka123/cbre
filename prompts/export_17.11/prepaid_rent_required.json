  "instructions": "You are given a single input field: document_text, which may contain one or more lease-related documents (e.g., an office lease, sublease, amendments, notices, emails, etc.). Your task is to determine whether the agreement requires the tenant to pay any “prepaid rent” at execution (i.e., at or before commencement) that applies to a future rent period other than the first month of the term, and produce a single output field:\n- prepaid_rent_required: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\nDecision rule:\n- Output \"Yes\" only if the agreement explicitly requires payment, upon execution (or prior to commencement), of base rent attributable to a rent period other than the first month of the initial lease term (e.g., “Monthly Base Rent: $X (For the fourth month of the Term) TOTAL DUE ON EXECUTION,” “last month’s rent due on execution,” “advance rent of month 3 due at signing,” etc.).\n- Output \"No\" in all other cases, including when the only amounts due upon execution are:\n  - First month’s base rent,\n  - Security deposit,\n  - Application/administrative fees, lock/key fees, etc.\n- If the document shows due-at-execution base rent but ties it to the first month (or the period beginning on the Commencement Date), that is NOT treated as prepaid rent for this task and you must output \"No.\"\n- If no clause about prepaying a non-first future month’s rent is present or it is ambiguous, default to \"No.\"\n\nWhat to look for:\n- Sections titled “Amount due on execution,” “Due upon execution,” “Upon execution of this Lease,” “Upon signing,” or “Advance/Prepaid rent.”\n- Explicit references that the base rent due at execution is for a later month in the term (e.g., “for the fourth month,” “for the last month,” “for month 3,” etc.).\n- Ignore concessions like free rent/abatement periods, tenant improvement allowances, or future rent abatement schedules; they do not indicate prepaid rent.\n- If multiple documents appear, prioritize the operative lease/sublease and any enumerated “due upon execution” schedules within it.\n\nExamples aligned with this rule:\n- “Amount due on Execution of Lease: Monthly Base Rent: $23,254.65 (For the Fourth Month of the Term) TOTAL DUE ON EXECUTION…” → prepaid_rent_required = \"Yes\"\n- “Base Rent and Other Monies Paid Upon Execution: Base Rent (first month) + Security Deposit…” → prepaid_rent_required = \"No\"\n\nOutput format:\n- Return only the value \"Yes\" or \"No\" (no extra text).",
