  "instructions": "You are given a single input field: document_text. Extract and return only the billing_city string for the Tenant as defined below. Output a single, trimmed city name with no quotes or punctuation.\n\nWHAT TO RETURN\n- Return only the Tenant’s billing/notice city (e.g., “Chula Vista”, “Charlotte”, “Roslyn Heights”).\n- Preserve multi‑word city names.\n- Do not include state, ZIP, commas, or quotes. Trim whitespace.\n\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\n- billing_city is the city in the Tenant’s official notice/billing/mailing address used for lease notices, not the property/site location, landlord address, manager/broker/attorney address, guarantor address, or payment/ACH/lockbox address.\n- Exception for “The Premises”: If the lease explicitly designates the Tenant’s notice/billing address as “The Premises,” use the city of the Premises/Building address.\n\nORDER OF PREFERENCE (use the highest that exists)\n1) Tenant notice/billing address within the lease\n   - Explicit blocks labeled like:\n     “Tenant’s Address,” “Tenant Notice Address,” “NOTICE ADDRESS—TENANT,” “Address for Notices to Tenant,” “Address of Tenant (Section …).”\n   - If the block distinguishes “prior to Lease Commencement Date” vs. “after Lease Commencement Date,” choose the “after” address (the one effective during the term).\n   - If the “after” address is shown as “The Premises,” use the Premises/Building city (see Special Handling below).\n   - AIR CRE NOTICE CLAUSE: On AIR CRE forms (e.g., “STANDARD INDUSTRIAL/COMMERCIAL MULTI-TENANT LEASE - GROSS,” “AIR CRE”), if the Notices section (often Paragraph 23.1) says something like “except that upon Lessee’s taking possession of the Premises, the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for notice,” then use the Premises city as the Tenant’s notice/billing city (even if a different address appears by the Tenant’s signature block) once the term/possession applies.\n\n2) Party definition near the start of the lease\n   - An explicit Tenant party definition that includes “having an office at …” or a clearly stated mailing/office address for the Tenant entity.\n\n3) Other Tenant-related documents in the package\n   - Use letters, cover pages, memos, OFAC/KYC reports, or labels addressed to or “Bill To” the Tenant that clearly reflect the Tenant’s mailing/notice/billing address.\n   - Only use these if no higher‑priority Tenant notice/billing address is present in the lease.\n\nSPECIAL HANDLING FOR “THE PREMISES”\n- If the Tenant address is designated as “The Premises,” find the Building/Premises address elsewhere in the document (e.g., “Building located and addressed at …,” “Premises: [full address]”) and return the city from that address.\n- This exception permits using the property address only because it is explicitly designated as the Tenant’s notice/billing address.\n\nIMPORTANT EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT USE)\n- Landlord addresses, property manager addresses, attorney/broker addresses.\n- Guarantor addresses.\n- Payment/remittance/lockbox/ACH/wiring/bank addresses (e.g., “Payment address,” “For ACH”).\n- Property/Building/Mall/Site location addresses UNLESS (a) the Tenant’s notice/billing address is explicitly “The Premises,” or (b) an AIR CRE notice clause states the Premises is the Lessee’s address for notice upon possession (see above).\n- “c/o” addresses for other entities unless clearly designated as the Tenant’s official notice/billing address and no higher-preference address exists.\n\nMULTIPLE ADDRESSES PRESENT\n- Prefer the Tenant notice/billing address block in the lease, especially any “after Lease Commencement Date” address.\n- If both corporate/headquarters and store addresses appear:\n  - If the Tenant notice/billing address is explicitly “The Premises,” use the Premises city.\n  - Otherwise, prefer the corporate/notice/billing address tied to the Tenant.\n- If only a store address appears and no separate corporate/notice/billing address is provided, use the store address city.\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\n- Scan for headings/labels: “Summary of Basic Lease Information,” “Tenant’s Address,” “Tenant Notice Address,” “NOTICE ADDRESS—TENANT,” “Address of Tenant (Section …),” “Address for Notices.”\n- Look for time qualifiers: “prior to Lease Commencement Date,” “after Lease Commencement Date.” Choose the “after” address.\n- If an address is “The Premises,” find the Premises/Building address elsewhere in the document and extract its city.\n- On AIR CRE leases, check the Notices section for language indicating that upon taking possession, the Premises becomes the Lessee’s notice address. If present, use the Premises city.\n- If none of the above found, check party definitions (“Tenant … having an office at …”).\n- If still not found, use other Tenant‑addressed documents in the package (OFAC, memos, cover letters) that reflect the Tenant’s mailing/notice/billing address.\n\nCITY PARSING RULES\n- If the address is “City, ST ZIP” or “City, State ZIP,” extract the City portion before the comma.\n- If the address is “City ST ZIP” (no comma), extract the City portion before the state abbreviation.\n- Preserve multi‑word cities (e.g., “El Centro”, “Roslyn Heights”).\n- Output must be a single trimmed string, no quotes or extra punctuation.\n\nEDGE CASES AND TIPS\n- Signature blocks: Many leases use the signature‑adjacent address as the party’s notice address. However, if the lease’s notice section overrides this (e.g., AIR CRE clause making the Premises the notice address upon possession), follow the override.\n- Avoid “With a copy to:” addresses unless the primary Tenant notice address is missing and the “copy to” is the only Tenant notice location.\n- Ignore addresses for brokers, managers, and landlords that often appear in the Summary or Notices section alongside the Tenant’s address.\n- When multiple instances of a candidate city are found, choose the one tied to the highest‑priority source above.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- Return only the city name. No state, ZIP, commas, quotes, or extra spaces.\n\nEXAMPLES OF KEY NUANCES\n- AIR CRE form: If Paragraph 23.1 (or similar) states that upon Lessee’s taking possession, “the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for notice,” then use the Premises city as billing_city (e.g., Premises: “9520 Padgett Road, Suite 217, San Diego, CA 92126” → return “San Diego”).\n- Summary “Address of Tenant: 3700 Embassy Parkway, Suite 500, Akron, OH 44333” → return “Akron.”\n- If the package lacks a lease notice address but includes an OFAC or similar Tenant-addressed report showing “City: Honolulu” for the Tenant, return “Honolulu.”\n\nQUALITY CHECK\n- Ensure the selected address truly pertains to the Tenant’s notice/billing address per the priority rules.\n- Ensure the returned city is trimmed and contains no punctuation.",
