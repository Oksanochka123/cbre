  "instructions": "Task: From the provided “document_text” (which may contain multiple real estate documents such as leases, amendments, addenda, estoppels, rent rolls), extract the tenant’s holdover rent terms and return exactly one minimal line.\n\nWhat to find (strictly):\n- A clause governing a tenant’s occupancy after expiration/termination (trigger words: “Holdover,” “Holding Over,” “hold over,” “tenant at sufferance,” “remains in possession after expiration/termination,” “continue occupancy after expiration,” “retain possession,” “after expiration without consent,” etc.).\n- Only extract when the clause clearly sets the amount payable during holdover (e.g., “rent shall be…,” “rental rate shall be…,” “during holdover… shall pay…”). Otherwise, see “Not permitted/Not specified” below.\n\nSpecial handling of “No Right to Holdover” language:\n- If the document expressly prohibits holdover (e.g., “No Right to Holdover,” “No right to retain possession beyond expiration/termination,” or materially similar language), prefer that prohibition over any numerical rate embedded in “damages” computations within that same clause. Output the prohibition succinctly (e.g., “No right to retain possession after expiration or termination.”). Do NOT convert any “damages” computation in such a clause into a holdover rate, even if it mentions 150% base rent or similar.\n- If there is only a prohibition and no explicit rent/rate for a permitted holdover period, do not infer a rate.\n\nWhat to extract (when a permitted holdover rate is clearly stated):\n- The applicable holdover rate:\n  - The percentage/multiplier (e.g., 150%, 200%, 300%, “1.5”, “2”, “3”).\n  - The rent basis if stated (e.g., “monthly Base Rent,” “Fixed Rent,” “rent in effect for the last month of the term”).\n  - Any critical qualifier controlling a higher rate (e.g., “without prior written consent”).\n- Convert words to numbers:\n  - “one and a half times” → 1.5 or 150%\n  - “double” → 2 or 200%\n  - “triple/three times” → 3 or 300%\n\nNormalization and output format (apply in order):\n1) Only if the clause explicitly uses the exact phrase “monthly Base Rent,” output:\n   “150% of monthly base rent in effect”\n   - Use this exact standardized phrase ONLY when the exact words “monthly Base Rent” appear.\n   - Do NOT use this format for “Basic Rent,” “Base Rent” (without “monthly”), “daily Basic Rent,” or when other components (e.g., operating expenses) are included. Use rule (2).\n\n2) If the clause ties holdover to “Fixed Rent,” “rent,” “Base/Basic Rent” (without the explicit “monthly” phrasing), or includes other components beyond Base Rent (e.g., “greater of Base Rent + OpEx or market”), output only the decimal multiplier (up to 2 decimals):\n   e.g., “1.5”, “2”, “3”.\n   - Examples mapping to decimal output:\n     - “150% of daily Basic Rent” → “1.5”\n     - “200% of rent then in effect” → “2”\n     - “150% of the greater of (a) Base Rent plus OpEx or (b) market rent” → “1.5”\n   - If multiple rates apply (with/without consent), report the highest.\n\n3) If a critical qualifier governs the highest rate (e.g., “without prior written consent to continue occupancy”), include it succinctly before the rate:\n   Example: “After expiration without prior written consent to continue occupancy, monthly rental rate 300%.”\n\nEdge cases and cautions (avoid hallucinations):\n- If an express “No Right to Holdover/No right to retain possession” clause exists, output that prohibition (see above), not a numeric rate.\n- If the text only states rights/remedies, termination, or generic “damages” language without clearly setting a holdover rent/rate, output: “Not specified”.\n- If multiple documents are present:\n  - Use the clause that explicitly sets the holdover amount for a permitted holdover. \n  - If there is an explicit prohibition on holdover in any operative document and no permitted holdover rate is separately and clearly provided, prefer the prohibition or “Not specified” (as appropriate) instead of deriving a rate.\n  - If conflicting or unclear, prefer “Not specified”.\n- Do not infer from rent rolls, summaries, or unrelated documents; use explicit lease/amendment/addendum text.\n- Choose the highest applicable rate if multiple are provided; include a minimal qualifier only if it controls that higher rate.\n- Do not include other details (month-to-month status, notices, termination rights, remedies).\n- Numbers:\n  - Percentages should be integers with “%”.\n  - Multipliers should be decimals with up to 2 decimals (e.g., 1.5, 2, 3).\n- Casing: use “base rent” (lowercase) in the standardized phrase when rule (1) applies.\n\nOutput:\n- Return exactly one short line with no quotes, no extra words.\n\nExamples mapping:\n- “If Tenant holds over, monthly Base Rent shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly Base Rent in effect…” → “150% of monthly base rent in effect”\n- “Holding Over: Fixed Rent shall be 150% of the applicable Fixed Rent” → “1.5”\n- “If Tenant remains in possession after expiration without prior written consent, the monthly rental rate shall be three (3) times the last month’s rent” → “After expiration without prior written consent to continue occupancy, monthly rental rate 300%.”\n- “If Tenant holds over, the amount due shall be one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of all Rent last in effect” → “1.25”\n- “Daily Basic Rent shall be 150% of the daily Basic Rent” → “1.5”\n- “No Right to Holdover. Lessee has no right to retain possession beyond expiration or termination…” (with only ‘damages’ language) → “No right to retain possession after expiration or termination.”\n- If no clear rate is provided for a permitted holdover → “Not specified”.",
