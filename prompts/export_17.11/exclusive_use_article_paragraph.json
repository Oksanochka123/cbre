  "instructions": "Task: Extract the Exclusive Use article/paragraph from a lease document.\n\nInput\n- document_text: a string containing the full lease text. It may be a normal string, an empty string (\"\" or only whitespace), or null/None.\n\nOutput\n- exclusive_use_article_paragraph: a single string containing the exact, verbatim paragraph that states the tenant’s exclusive use rights, or a fallback per the rules below. If nothing should be returned, output null (do not output placeholder text).\n\nGeneral rules\n- Return only the exclusive_use_article_paragraph value. Do not include any explanations, labels, or additional fields.\n- Do not summarize, paraphrase, or invent content. When found, return the exact paragraph text from document_text (trim leading/trailing whitespace only).\n- Do not add headings or commentary (e.g., “Exclusive Use:” or “Found clause:”). Return only the raw paragraph text.\n- Use plain ASCII punctuation; do not introduce fancy dashes/quotes. Do not add any characters that are not in the source text.\n\nFinding the Exclusive Use clause\n1) Primary target: Look for a section/paragraph explicitly titled or referring to “Exclusive Use,” “Exclusivity,” or a defined term like “Exclusive Use” (case-insensitive). Common placements include headings, articles, sections, exhibits, or riders.\n2) If no explicit heading exists, search for text that clearly grants exclusivity to the tenant’s business or products, e.g.:\n   - “Tenant shall have the exclusive right to …”\n   - “Landlord shall not lease to any other tenant that …”\n   - “No other tenant shall sell/operate …”\n   - “Exclusivity” or “exclusive rights” tied to Tenant’s permitted use.\n3) Include a clause that explicitly denies exclusivity (e.g., “Tenant acknowledges no exclusivity is granted”) if that is the only “exclusive use” discussion present.\n4) Exclude unrelated “exclusive” concepts (e.g., “exclusive remedy,” “exclusive jurisdiction,” “exclusive possession” in the general landlord/tenant sense).\n5) If multiple paragraphs discuss exclusivity, prefer the single paragraph that most directly states the grant, scope, or denial of the tenant’s exclusive use rights. If necessary, choose the paragraph that contains the core operative language; do not concatenate multiple paragraphs unless the exclusivity is inseparable and contained within one continuous paragraph in the source.\n\nFallback rules when not found\n- If document_text is null/None: output null (no string, no placeholder).\n- If document_text is a present string but contains no Exclusive Use clause (including empty string \"\" or only whitespace): output exactly:\n  Lease is Silent.\n  (Match this capitalization and period exactly.)\n- Do not output messages like “Not found,” “No document provided,” or any other commentary.\n\nFormatting\n- Preserve the original paragraph text exactly (spacing and punctuation) except for trimming leading/trailing whitespace.\n- Do not introduce or remove sentences.\n- Return a single string value for exclusive_use_article_paragraph (or null as specified above).",
