  "instructions": "You are given a document_text. Extract and output the tenant/lessee billing address as a single string containing ONLY the street address and an optional suite/unit, normalized as specified below. Do not include any reasoning or extra text.\n\nWhat to extract (strict priority; use the first applicable source):\n1) Tenant’s/Lessee’s mailing/notices/billing address shown in any “Basic Lease Information,” “Notices,” “Notice Address,” or similarly labeled block for Tenant/Lessee.\n   - If the block shows multiple periods (e.g., “Prior to Commencement Date” and “From/On and After Commencement Date”), select the current/primary mailing address (typically the “From/On and After Commencement Date” address). Ignore any “prior” address.\n   - If the Tenant notices block says the address is “The Premises” without listing the street there, derive the street from the Building/Premises address elsewhere in the document and pair it with the Premises suite (see Premises fallback rules below).\n   - If a Tenant notices block lists a main address and “copy to” addresses, use only the main Tenant address and ignore copies.\n2) A Tenant/Lessee address line in the signature block (often labeled “Address:” or appearing with the Tenant/Lessee name). Use only if no Tenant notices/billing address is present.\n3) As a last resort, the “Premises” street address line, using only the street and suite/unit portion (stop before any city/state/ZIP).\n   - Only use the Premises fallback if neither a Tenant notices/billing address nor a signature-block Tenant address is present anywhere in the document OR if the Tenant notices block explicitly states “The Premises” as the current address without listing the street.\n   - Do not take any Landlord, Landlord’s payment remit, property management, or shopping center/office management office addresses as the Tenant address.\n   - Do not use building management “office” addresses or rent payment addresses. These are for Landlord, not Tenant.\n\nImportant disambiguation rules:\n- Search the entire document. Tenant/Lessee addresses may appear in Basic Lease Information, dedicated Notices sections, signature blocks, letterhead/footer blocks near Tenant’s signature, or exhibits.\n- If multiple versions of the same Tenant street appear (e.g., “9245 Activity Road” and “9245 Activity Rd.”), prefer the fully spelled-out street suffix form (“Road” over “Rd”) when they clearly refer to the same location. Otherwise, preserve the form in the selected source.\n- Do not use Landlord addresses (including “Payments to Landlord,” “Notices to Landlord,” asset manager, property manager, landlord PO boxes) under any circumstance as the Tenant address.\n- Ignore any “copy to” or attorney/agent addresses. Use the Tenant’s primary mailing/notices address only.\n- If the document is an amendment that does not restate the Tenant notices address, still search the whole document (including signature areas) for any Tenant address. Only fall back to the Premises if the Tenant address truly does not appear and there is an explicit instruction to use “The Premises,” or no Tenant mailing address is present anywhere.\n\nInclude only:\n- Street number and street name (e.g., “700 S. Flower Street” or “2807 Sunset Boulevard”).\n- The suite/unit identifier and number, normalized to “Suite <value>” if and only if a valid suite/unit label is present (see below).\n\nExclude:\n- City, state, ZIP/postal code.\n- Company or person names, building names, project names, shopping center names, “Attn:” lines, department/mailstop/room/floor references, email, phone, or any other metadata.\n- PO Boxes or any non-street addresses.\n- Country.\n- Any Landlord/management/remit-to addresses.\n\nSuite/unit detection and normalization:\n- Recognize suite/unit labels on, or clearly tied to, the address line: “Suite”, “Ste”, “Ste.”, “#”, “Apt”, “Unit”.\n- Convert all of the above to “Suite <value>”, removing any leading “#” (e.g., “Ste 120”, “Ste. 120”, “#120”, “Unit 120”, “Apt 120” → “Suite 120”).\n- Do NOT infer a suite/unit from:\n  - Words like “Space”, “Room/Rm”, “Dept/Department”, “Mail Stop/MS”, “Floor/Fl/Level”, hyphenated internal codes (e.g., “5325-RM100”), or building-specific internal codes.\n  - Labels such as “Building/Bldg”, “Tower”, “Phase”, or “Area”.\n  - Premises identifiers like “Space D300” should NOT be turned into a suite; only treat it as a suite if the document explicitly uses a valid suite/unit label as listed above (e.g., “Suite D300” or “Unit D300”).\n- If no valid suite/unit is present, return only the street address.\n\nStreet/casing normalization:\n- Preserve the street wording and casing as it appears in the selected source line (e.g., keep “Road” vs “Rd”, “Drive” vs “Dr”, “Boulevard” vs “Blvd” exactly as shown). Do not force-abbreviate or expand street suffixes.\n- Directionals: keep as they appear in the selected source (e.g., “South” vs “S.”). Do not convert unless needed to remove extraneous punctuation.\n- Preserve periods in abbreviations if present in the source (e.g., keep “Dr.” if it appears).\n- Remove extraneous trailing punctuation (e.g., trailing commas) but do not alter the substantive street/suffix text.\n\nJoining and punctuation:\n- If both a valid street line and a valid suite/unit are present, join them with a single comma and a single space:\n  - “700 S. Flower Street, Suite 860”\n  - “2807 Sunset Blvd, Suite 220”\n- If street and suite are on separate lines in the source, still join them with a comma as above.\n- Do not include any other commas (e.g., before city/state/ZIP) or any trailing punctuation.\n\nSelection clarifications and pitfalls to avoid:\n- If a Tenant notices/billing block lists “The Premises” as the address but does not show the street there, derive the street from the Building/Premises description elsewhere and pair it with the Premises’ valid suite (if present with a valid label).\n- If multiple tenant address blocks exist, choose the current/primary one and ignore any “prior” addresses.\n- If both a Tenant notices block and a signature block exist, prefer the notices block (but you may use the more fully spelled-out street form found elsewhere when the same address appears both ways, per the disambiguation rule above).\n- Do not mix different addresses. Only combine street and suite when they clearly belong to the same address.\n- In retail/shopping center documents, do NOT use the shopping center’s management office address or Landlord’s center office address as the Tenant address.\n- Do not use rent payment instruction addresses (“Payments to Landlord,” lockboxes, PO Boxes) as the Tenant address.\n\nQuality checks before returning:\n- The output contains only the street number + street name and an optional normalized “Suite <value>”.\n- No city, state, ZIP, names, building names, shopping center names, “Attn”, department, room, floor, PO Box, or landlord/management/remit addresses.\n- If a suite/unit is included, it uses “Suite <value>” (labels normalized as specified).\n- Street and suite (if any) are separated by exactly one “, ”.\n- Trim leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nOutput format:\n- Return only the normalized street + optional suite string, e.g.:\n  - “931 14th Street”\n  - “700 S. Flower Street, Suite 860”\n  - “2807 Sunset Blvd, Suite 220”",
