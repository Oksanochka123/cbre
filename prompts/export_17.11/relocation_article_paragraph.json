  "instructions": "You are given a single input field:\n- document_text: raw OCR/text from one or more real estate documents (leases, amendments, estoppels, rent rolls, emails, insurance certs, database/profile printouts, etc.).\n\nYour job is to output exactly one field:\n- relocation_article_paragraph: a single string that precisely locates the landlord’s general right to relocate the tenant in the controlling lease, following the search scope, decision rules, and formatting below.\n\nWhat to find (Primary lease only)\n- Identify the clause in the tenant’s controlling lease that gives the landlord an ongoing right to move/relocate the tenant to other (typically comparable) space (e.g., “Relocation,” “Relocate,” “Relocation of Premises,” “Relocation of Tenant,” “Substituted Premises,” “Landlord may move Tenant,” “Right to substitute premises”).\n- This may be:\n  - A standalone article/section (e.g., “Relocation of Premises,” “Substituted Premises”)\n  - A numbered sub-section within a broader article (e.g., Article III, Section 3.4 Relocation)\n  - Clearly identified in a Table of Contents or in a lease profile/database summary that specifies an article/section number.\n- Treat “Substituted Premises” as relocation.\n- Do not confuse with or return clauses about: casualty, condemnation, temporary moves for repairs/construction phasing, path-of-travel/ADA, redevelopment/demolition/termination options, or “Premises Restoration.” These are not general landlord relocation rights.\n\nControlling lease selection (multi-document packets)\n- If multiple documents are present, select the controlling lease governing the subject tenant’s occupancy for the relevant premises/property. Prefer the most authoritative indicators:\n  - The fully executed office/retail/industrial “Lease” for the named tenant and the property at issue\n  - Execution dates\n  - Matching building/property name and address\n- Amendments/estoppels/cover memos may be used only if they clearly introduce or explicitly identify the governing relocation article/section of the controlling lease.\n- If the packet includes clearly different leases for different properties and it’s ambiguous which one applies, do not guess—return “Not Applicable” (unless the materials explicitly use “na” or “N/A”; see Output rules).\n\nSearch strategy (recommended)\n1) Scan the lease’s Table of Contents for “Relocation,” “Relocate,” “Substituted Premises,” or similar. Note the Article/Section number and any page(s).\n2) Full-text search for: relocate, relocation, relocated, substituted premises, substitute premises, substitute space, move tenant, landlord may move, right to move, right to relocate.\n3) Verify the clause confers an ongoing landlord right to relocate tenant to other premises (not temporary decanting for repairs/casualty/condemnation).\n4) If both TOC and body are available, rely on the body’s explicit section number if there’s a conflict. If both align, you may append the page(s) shown in TOC.\n5) If a header is numbered like “19. RELOCATION OF PREMISES” without “Article/Section” labeling, treat it as a Section if possible; otherwise return Article.\n6) Lease profiles/database exports are acceptable only if they clearly identify the relocation clause with its article/section number. Do not invent numbers.\n\nDecision rules\n- If a relocation/substituted premises clause exists in the controlling lease:\n  - Return the most specific locator available: “Lease, Section <number>” (preferable) or “Lease, Article <number>”.\n  - If the TOC/profile explicitly shows page(s) for that entry, append “, Page <page or page-range>”.\n  - Decimal numbering is allowed (e.g., “Lease, Section 10.7”).\n- If no landlord relocation right exists anywhere in the controlling lease (including TOC and amendments):\n  - Return exactly: “Lease is Silent.” (note capital ‘S’ and trailing period).\n- If the packet contains no lease text/sections to analyze (e.g., only rent rolls, estoppels without section numbering, consents, emails, insurance certificates, commencement/expiration memos, or similar ancillary documents):\n  - Return an empty string (i.e., produce a blank output).\n- If the packet includes several unrelated leases for different properties and it is unclear which one applies:\n  - Return “Not Applicable”.\n- If the documents themselves explicitly use “N/A”, “na”, or “Not Applicable” to denote non-applicability:\n  - Return that exact string as shown in the materials (preserve exact casing/punctuation).\n\nStrict output format (only these are allowed)\n- “Lease, Section <number>” [optional: “, Page <x>”]\n- “Lease, Article <number>” [optional: “, Page <x>”]\n- “Lease is Silent.” (note the capital ‘S’ and trailing period)\n- “Not Applicable” (or exactly “na” / “N/A” if that exact form appears in the provided materials)\n- An empty string (only when the packet is clearly non-lease content with no sections to analyze)\n\nFormatting constraints\n- Do not output both Article and Section; choose the most specific available (Section > Article).\n- Do not add a trailing period to “Lease, Section …” or “Lease, Article …” outputs.\n- Include “, Page …” only if page reference(s) are explicitly provided in the TOC/profile for that exact entry.\n- Preserve exact casing when returning “na”, “N/A”, or “Not Applicable” if those appear in the documents.\n\nProhibitions\n- Do not quote clause text or add commentary/explanations.\n- Do not fabricate article/section numbers or page references.\n- Do not treat termination, demolition, redevelopment, casualty, condemnation, repairs/temporary decanting, or “Premises Restoration” as relocation.\n- Output exactly one string value and nothing else (no reasoning, no labels, no JSON wrapper).\n\nDisambiguation examples\n- If TOC lists “Section 19 Relocation of Premises, Page 45” and the body shows “Section 19.1 Relocation of Premises,” return “Lease, Section 19.1, Page 45” (if page 45 clearly corresponds), otherwise “Lease, Section 19.1”.\n- If only the TOC shows “Relocation of Premises – Section 12, Pages 30-31” and the body pages are missing, “Lease, Section 12, Page 30-31” is acceptable.\n- If the lease uses a numbered header like “19. RELOCATION OF PREMISES” (no “Article/Section” label), treat as section: “Lease, Section 19”.\n\nQuality checks before finalizing\n- Verify the clause is truly a general landlord relocation right.\n- Verify the section/article numbering and, if used, the page references are explicit in the materials.\n- If no valid relocation clause is found in the controlling lease, return “Lease is Silent.”\n- If only ancillary documents are present with no lease sections, return an empty string.\n- If the packet is cross-property ambiguous, return “Not Applicable” (or the exact “na”/“N/A” seen in the documents).\n\nOutput only the final string that matches one of the allowed formats above.",
