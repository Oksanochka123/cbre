  "instructions": "You are given a single input field: document_text. Your task is to output exactly one field: relocation_description.\n\nObjective\n- Detect whether the document contains a landlord unilateral relocation/right-to-substitute premises clause (i.e., LL may move T to other space), and return one concise string per the rules below.\n\nStrict output rules\n- Output only the relocation_description string with no labels, no reasoning, no extra fields.\n- Allowed outputs are exactly one of:\n  • A concise one-sentence summary (retail/shopping center only; see “Retail summary rules”).\n  • na (literal lower-case na) for AIR standard-form “Substituted Premises” clauses in industrial/office/warehouse leases (or equivalent standard form).\n  • See section X (exactly this format with the section number) for non-AIR industrial/office/warehouse relocation clauses when a clear section number heading appears.\n  • None (exactly “None”) if no relocation/substitution clause exists, or if the document is not a lease/occupancy agreement.\n- Single line, no trailing/leading spaces. Use plain ASCII punctuation (straight apostrophes ' not curly ’).\n\nDocument type handling and decision order\n1) Not a lease/occupancy agreement (e.g., COIs, commencement/delivery/possession or lease date letters/memos, notices) → None.\n2) Retail/shopping center leases or retail licenses (e.g., “shop lease,” “specialty license,” storefront coffee/food/retail in a center/project):\n   - If there is an explicit unilateral right for LL to relocate/substitute premises within the center/project, return a concise retail summary (see below).\n   - Otherwise → None.\n3) Industrial/warehouse/office leases:\n   - If no relocation/substitution clause → None.\n   - If it is an AIR “Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease” (or comparable AIR/standard form) with the generic “Substituted Premises” or relocation clause → na (do not summarize).\n   - If a relocation clause exists and is not an AIR/standard-form generic clause:\n       • If a clear section number heading is present for that clause → output “See section X” (e.g., “See section 19”).\n       • If no clear section number is identifiable → na.\n   - Do not infer a clause from table of contents only if the body section is “Reserved” or contains no relocation content; in that case → None.\n\nRetail summary rules (apply only to retail/shopping center leases/licenses)\n- Output one compact sentence (ideally under ~15–20 words) that:\n  • States that LL may relocate/substitute T within the center/project; include required notice period.\n  • Prefer the term used in the document (“relocate” or “substitute other premises”). If the lease defines “Project,” prefer “within the project”; otherwise “within the center.”\n- Keep it minimal to avoid penalty: include the notice and the right. Omit comparability, rent change, costs, and amendment details unless the clause lacks a notice period (in which case summarize the right alone).\n- Use abbreviations “LL” (landlord) and “T” (tenant) if needed for brevity.\n- Examples of acceptable style:\n  • LL may substitute other premises within the project with 60 days' written notice.\n  • LL may relocate T within the center on 45 days' prior written notice.\n\nFormatting\n- Use exactly:\n  • None\n  • na\n  • See section X (e.g., See section 24.19)\n  • Or the retail one-sentence summary per above.\n- Do not include quotes, labels, or extra punctuation beyond what’s needed for the sentence.\n\nScope and exclusions\n- Do not treat as relocation: provisions about showing space, alterations, casualty/condemnation, assignment/recapture, redevelopment/termination rights, temporary moves for repairs without a unilateral right to substitute premises, or general building renovations without a move right.\n- If a TOC lists “Relocation/Substitution” but the section is “Reserved” or contains no relocation terms → None.\n\nDetection cues\n- Keywords: Relocation, Relocate Tenant, Relocation of Premises, Substituted Premises, Substitution of Premises, substitute other premises, move tenant, landlord may substitute other space.\n- Retail/shopping center context: shopping center, mall, storefront, percentage rent, center rules/marketing fund.\n- Industrial/office/warehouse AIR context: “Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease (AIR)”, AIR form names, park/project/building references typical of AIR forms.\n\nEdge cases and disambiguation\n- If the clause exists only as a standard AIR “Substituted Premises” provision in an AIR industrial/office/warehouse lease → na.\n- If a non-AIR industrial/office/warehouse lease has a relocation clause and a clearly numbered section heading → use “See section X”.\n- If only a TOC shows “Relocation/Substitution” but the body has no content (or is “Reserved”) → None.\n- If the document is a certificate of insurance, SNDA, commencement/expiration memo, or other non-lease document → None.\n\nOutput quality checks\n- Ensure ASCII apostrophes in the notice phrase (e.g., 60 days' written notice).\n- Keep retail summaries ultra-brief; do not add comparability, rent, or costs unless absolutely necessary.",
