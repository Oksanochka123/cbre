  "instructions": "Task\nGiven a single input field document_text (which may contain one or more full documents such as a lease, “New Lease,” amendments, addenda, renewal/extension letters, exhibits, work letters, OFAC reports, etc.), extract and return actual_lease_start_date as a single ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD) representing the exact date the lease/license term begins (the true “Commencement Date” of the term), not merely when the document was signed.\n\nWhat to return\n- Exactly one date in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n- No extra text, labels, punctuation, or explanations.\n\nCore definition (anchor your choice with this concept)\n- actual_lease_start_date = the date the term begins (often labeled “Commencement Date,” “Lease Commencement Date,” “Term shall commence,” or similar). Only use an “Effective Date” if the agreement explicitly states the Term commences on the Effective Date.\n\nImportant document set handling (multi-document inputs)\n- The input may include multiple related or unrelated documents (older leases, amendments, renewal letters, and a newer “New Lease”).\n- Prioritize the governing lease that most recently creates a new term for a space (e.g., a document titled “New Lease” or a new “STANDARD … LEASE” with its own Basic Provisions/Term/Commencement Date). Do not default to the oldest lease if a newer lease is present.\n- If only amendments/extension letters are present (no new lease), these typically do not create a new commencement date; retain the original lease’s commencement date unless an amendment explicitly sets a new commencement/start-of-term date.\n- Ignore unrelated attachments (e.g., OFAC reports) for commencement.\n- Suites/addresses may differ across documents; if a new lease for a different suite is present in the same project/campus (e.g., same business center), prefer the new lease’s Commencement Date over earlier leases for other suites unless the text clearly ties you to a different governing lease.\n\nOrder of precedence (apply in order and stop once determined)\n1) An explicit calendar date labeled as the term start:\n   - Examples:\n     • “Commencement Date is [date].”\n     • “Lease Commencement Date is [date].”\n     • “Term shall commence on [date].”\n     • “Tenant shall have and hold for an initial term … commencing on [date].”\n     • “The period beginning [date] (‘Commencement Date’) and ending …”\n   - If the lease states that the term is deemed to begin on the first day of the next month when Commencement falls mid-month (e.g., “If the Commencement Date falls on a day other than the first day of a calendar month then the term shall be measured from the first day of the month following …”), then use that term commencement date (the first of the next month) as the actual_lease_start_date.\n2) An explicit expected commencement date when no later clause computes/overrides it:\n   - Example: “Commencement Date … is currently expected to occur on [date].”\n3) A formula-based definition that can be computed from data in the document:\n   - Examples:\n     • “Commencement Date is the earlier of (i) the day Tenant opens for business or (ii) 150 days after the Possession Date.” Use provided inputs to compute; otherwise do not guess.\n     • “Commencement Date is the earlier of 60 days after the Building Permit or September 15, 2003.” Compute per rule. If the lease also states that the term is measured from the first day of the next month when Commencement falls mid-month, then return that first-of-next-month date.\n     • “Commencement Date = X business days after execution by both parties.” Business days = Monday–Friday; ignore holidays unless specified.\n   - When computing:\n     • “within one (1) business day following [date]” = the next business day (Mon–Fri; ignore holidays unless specified).\n     • “N days after [date]” = add N calendar days unless explicitly stated business days.\n     • Apply “earlier of” / “later of” correctly using defined inputs.\n4) Clear narrative stating the start of term (e.g., “commencing at 12:01 a.m. on [date]”).\n5) Only if none of the above is available and the text explicitly ties “Effective Date” or “Execution Date” to the term beginning (e.g., “the Term commences on the Effective Date”), then use that date.\n\nSpecial source types and exhibits\n- “Declaration/Memorandum of Lease Commencement”:\n  • Use it only if it is filled with a date and clearly executed/final (not a blank/template exhibit).\n  • If the main lease text (Term section) and a fully executed commencement declaration conflict, prefer the later, executed declaration if it expressly finalizes the Commencement Date; otherwise prefer the explicit Term provision.\n- “Early Possession” or “Possession Date” does NOT, by itself, start the term; ignore for commencement unless the lease explicitly equates it with commencement.\n- “Rent Abatement/Free Rent” does NOT affect commencement.\n\nMultiple agreements in one input (practical prioritization)\n- If a newer “New Lease” (or a fully formed lease with basic provisions and its own Term/Commencement) appears alongside older leases/amendments, prefer the newer lease’s Commencement Date.\n- If only amendments/renewals are present, and none state a new start of term, stick with the original lease’s commencement date.\n- If multiple leases are present for different suites/addresses, and one is clearly the newer/current governing lease (e.g., by title “New Lease” and a later Commencement Date), return that newer lease’s Commencement Date.\n\nSynonyms/phrases to recognize as start-of-term indicators\n- “Commencement Date”, “Lease Commencement Date”, “Rent Commencement Date” (only if explicitly the same as lease commencement), “Term shall commence”, “commencing on”, “beginning on”, “the period beginning [date]”, “start date”, “license period begins”.\n\nDate normalization\n- Convert any textual date to ISO (YYYY-MM-DD). Examples:\n  • “the 8th day of July, 2025” → “2025-07-08”.\n  • Ignore time-of-day (“12:01 a.m.”).\n\nExclusions and cautions\n- Do NOT default to “effective as of” or signature/execution dates unless the agreement explicitly states the term starts on that date.\n- Do NOT use Early Possession/Delivery dates unless equated to commencement in the text.\n- Do NOT infer or guess missing inputs for formulas; if inputs are missing, prefer any explicit/expected commencement date from the document.\n- Do NOT rely on a blank/unexecuted “Declaration of Commencement” template.\n\nOutput\n- Only the date string in YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nExamples of correct behavior (drawn from common patterns)\n- If a Basic Provisions section states “Term … commencing May 15, 2022 (‘Commencement Date’)”, return 2022-05-15.\n- If the input contains older leases (e.g., 2018) and a later standalone “New Lease” with its own Basic Provisions stating “Commencement Date” November 1, 2023, return 2023-11-01 (ignore the older lease).\n- If the lease states “Commencement Date is the earlier of 60 days after Building Permit or September 15, 2003” and also provides that the term is measured from the first day of the following month when Commencement falls mid-month, return the first day of the next month.",
