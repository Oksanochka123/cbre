  "instructions": "You are given:\n- document_text: the raw text content of one or more real-estate/lease-related documents (e.g., leases, amendments, distribution memos, notices, guarantees), potentially concatenated.\n\nYour task:\n- Output exactly one field: billing_phone\n\nGoal:\n- Extract the tenant’s billing/contact phone number from the document_text.\n- If you cannot confidently identify a tenant billing phone, output exactly: unknown\n\nWhat counts as “billing_phone”:\n- A direct phone number for the tenant’s billing/accounts payable contact, or if not explicitly labeled, the tenant’s own/main business phone number.\n- Acceptable sources/labels near the number for the tenant: “Billing”, “Bill To”, “Accounts Payable”, “AP”/“A/P”, “Accounting”, “Finance”, “Invoice”, “Remit/Remittance”, “Payables”, “Accounts Dept”, “Tenant”, “Lessee”, “Tenant Notice”.\n- Mobile/cell or main business phone for the tenant is acceptable if no explicit billing/AP phone is present.\n- If multiple tenant numbers exist, prefer one labeled for billing/AP; otherwise use the tenant’s main phone.\n\nDo NOT use numbers tied to:\n- Landlord/Lessor, property manager/management company, brokers, attorneys/law firms, notaries, couriers, banks/wire/remittance lockboxes, USPS/FedEx/shipping labels, DocuSign/DocVerify/service providers, OFAC screening reports, or general document processing services.\n- Guarantors/sureties/parent companies unless the number is explicitly labeled as the tenant’s billing/AP contact.\n- Fax numbers (anything labeled “Fax”, “F”, “Facsimile”).\n- Notary seals/commissions, disclaimers, headers/footers for e-signature services, or rate/fee calculations (e.g., rent math).\n- Banking details (ABA/routing/account), postal barcodes, transaction IDs, page counters.\n\nDisambiguation and selection rules (apply in order):\n1) Scan for billing blocks:\n   - Look for sections or lines labeled with/near: “Billing”, “Bill To”, “Accounts Payable”, “AP”/“A/P”, “Accounting”, “Finance”, “Payables”, “Invoice”, “Remit/Remittance”, “Send invoices to”.\n   - If a 10-digit US phone appears in that block clearly tied to the tenant, select it.\n\n2) If none, scan for tenant contact blocks:\n   - Find “Tenant”, “Lessee”, or “Tenant Notice Address” blocks.\n   - Use the phone associated with the tenant entity, not with landlord/manager/broker/attorney.\n\n3) If both tenant and landlord numbers are present:\n   - Choose the tenant’s number and explicitly exclude landlord/property manager/asset manager numbers.\n\n4) Exclusion proximity cues:\n   - If a phone is near words like “Landlord”, “Lessor”, “Property Management/Manager”, specific management company names, “Attorney/Esq/LLP”, “Broker”, “Remit to Landlord”, “Bank/Wire/ABA/Account”, “Notary/Commission”, “DocuSign/DocVerify”, “OFAC”, do NOT use it.\n\n5) Guaranties:\n   - Ignore SSNs/EINs or other identity numbers.\n   - Only use a phone from a guaranty if explicitly labeled as the tenant’s billing/AP contact.\n\n6) If multiple tenant phones appear:\n   - Prefer the one labeled “Billing/Accounts Payable/AP/Accounting/Finance”.\n   - Else prefer one labeled “Phone/Tel/Cell/Mobile” for the tenant.\n   - If still ambiguous, choose the phone nearest (in lines) to the tenant name/address block.\n\n7) If the only numbers present are clearly not the tenant’s or not billing-related:\n   - Output unknown.\n\nPhone detection and formatting:\n- Accept only US 10-digit numbers. Valid patterns include:\n  - (###) ###-####, ###-###-####, ###.###.####, ### ###-####, +1 ### ### ####, +1-###-###-####, and condensed forms like 1########## or ##########.\n- Ignore extensions; if found (e.g., “x123”, “ext 1234”), drop the extension and use the base 10-digit number.\n- Ignore 7-digit local numbers (e.g., “282-6224”) unless a clear matching area code is present alongside; otherwise, do not use them.\n- Normalization:\n  - If the source already shows a clear 10-digit US phone in a consistent human-readable format (e.g., “808 650-1489”, “808-650-1489”, “808.650.1489”), you may preserve that exact separator style.\n  - Otherwise, normalize to ###-###-####:\n    - Strip parentheses, spaces, dots, and leading “+1” or “1”.\n    - Keep hyphens between 3-3-4 digits (e.g., “808-650-1489”).\n- Remove trailing punctuation around numbers (e.g., commas, semicolons).\n\nOCR and noisy text cautions:\n- Treat OCR-garbled tokens carefully; extract only valid phone patterns.\n- Avoid numeric strings from rent math, dates, zip codes, page numbers, transaction IDs.\n- Do not infer a phone number from an email domain or address.\n\nConcatenated documents:\n- Search the entire document_text, including exhibits, signature pages, and appended memos/notices.\n- Still prefer numbers tied to the tenant entity in the leasing/billing context.\n- Skip appended compliance or service reports (e.g., OFAC) unless they clearly contain the tenant’s billing phone (rare).\n\nOutput:\n- Provide only the billing_phone value with no extra text.\n- If you cannot confidently identify a valid tenant billing phone following the rules above, output exactly: unknown\n\nExamples of acceptable cues near the chosen number (non-exhaustive):\n- “Tenant/Lessee: [Tenant Name] … Phone/Tel/Cell: (808) 650-1489”\n- “Bill To / Accounts Payable / AP Contact / Accounting / Finance: … Phone: 555-123-4567”\n- “Tenant Notice Address … Phone: 303.555.0199”\n\nExamples of unacceptable sources:\n- “Landlord/Property Manager … Phone: …”\n- “Send rent payments to … [Landlord’s address/lockbox] … Phone: …”\n- “Attorney at Law … Tel: …”\n- “Wire/ACH/Bank … Routing/Account … Phone: …”\n- “Notary Public … Commission … Phone: …”\n- “DocuSign/DocVerify footer … Phone: …”\n- “OFAC/Screening report …”",
