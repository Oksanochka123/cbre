  "instructions": "You are given a single input field: document_text. Your task is to output a single field: premise_state.\n\nGoal\n- Extract the U.S. state in which the leased Premises/Property/Building is located, and output the full state name as a single string.\n\nWhat to look for (in priority order)\n1) Premises/Property/Building location:\n   - Phrases like “Premises,” “Property,” or “Building located at …” followed by a street address and state.\n   - Legal descriptions such as “City of [X], County of [Y], State of [Z]” (use the “State of [Z]”).\n   - Suite references (e.g., “Suite 102 … located at [address], [State] [ZIP]”).\n2) If the exact premises location is not explicitly stated, use the “Choice of Law”/“governed by” clause as a fallback.\n3) If neither is available, use other clear indicators directly tied to the premises (e.g., consent letter identifying the specific property address).\n\nWhat to ignore\n- States appearing only in:\n  - Entity formations (e.g., “a Delaware limited partnership”).\n  - Mailing/payment/banking/wire/lockbox addresses for rent, notices, or management (e.g., St. Louis, MO lockbox).\n  - Property manager or broker office addresses not identified as the Premises.\n  - General references to statutes from multiple jurisdictions unless they identify the governing law or the Property’s state.\n- Do not pick a state solely because it appears most frequently; rely on Premises/Property/Building location.\n\nOutput formatting rules\n- Return exactly one state name, fully spelled out in title case (e.g., “Michigan”, “Colorado”, “Hawaii”, “New York”, “District of Columbia”).\n- Do not use postal abbreviations (e.g., “MI”, “CO”, “HI”).\n- Do not include cities, ZIP codes, punctuation, or duplicate states (e.g., not “Michigan, Michigan”).\n- No extra words such as “State of” or “USA”.\n\nDisambiguation guidance\n- If multiple states appear, select the state explicitly tied to the Premises/Property/Building definition.\n- If that is not clear, prefer the legal description (“State of [X]”) tied to the Property.\n- If still ambiguous, use the governing law clause.\n- If multiple documents are included (e.g., lease, amendment, consent letter, reports), prioritize the lease or lease amendments to identify the Premises’ state; consent letters can be used if they clearly identify the same property; ignore unrelated addresses.\n\nExamples of correct extraction cues\n- “Building located at 5700 Crooks Road, Troy, MI 48098” → Michigan\n- “City of Greenwood Village, County of Arapahoe, State of Colorado” → Colorado\n- “91-1085 Enterprise Avenue, Kapolei, Hawaii 96707” → Hawaii\n\nFinal instruction\n- Read document_text, identify the leased Premises’ state using the rules above, and output only the full state name as a single string.",
