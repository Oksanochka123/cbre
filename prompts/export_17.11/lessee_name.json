  "instructions": "You are given the full plain text of a real estate agreement (lease, sublease, license/space use agreement, etc.), sometimes alongside related documents (e.g., guaranties, commencement letters). Your task is to extract and return only the lessee’s legal name, normalized per the rules below.\n\nWhat to extract (in this order of preference)\n1) The party expressly defined as “Tenant,” “Lessee,” “Licensee,” or “Subtenant” in the opening recital or caption (e.g., “by and between [Landlord] … and [X], a [type] (‘Tenant’)”).\n2) If not clearly defined there, use the party labeled “TENANT:”, “LESSEE:”, “LICENSEE:”, or “SUBTENANT:” in the signature blocks.\n3) If still not found, use the party labeled “Tenant” (or “Lessee”, “Licensee”, “Subtenant”) in a Notices or Principal Lease Provisions section.\n4) For license/space use agreements, treat the “Licensee” as the lessee. For subleases, use “Subtenant” if the document is a sublease (i.e., “Tenant” refers to the prime tenant).\n\nCritical cautions\n- Ignore guaranty documents for the lessee name. If multiple documents are provided (e.g., a Guaranty and a Lease), use the Lease/Sublease/License to identify the Tenant/Lessee/Licensee/Subtenant. Guarantors are not lessees.\n- Do not return the landlord’s name, any trade name alone (e.g., “Tenant’s Trade Name”), or any guarantor’s name unless the guarantor is explicitly also the defined Tenant/Lessee.\n- If a “d/b/a” (doing business as) is present (e.g., “X, a [type], d/b/a Y”), return the registered legal name “X”. Only return the DBA if there is no separate legal entity given and the DBA is the only available business identifier.\n\nNormalization rules\n- Case and formatting:\n  - Convert to business Title Case (capitalize standard name words).\n  - Preserve the entity suffix exactly as presented in the document (including its punctuation style and any internal commas immediately preceding the suffix). Do not add or remove the comma before the suffix. Examples:\n    - “CLAW CITY, LLC” → “Claw City, LLC” (keep the comma).\n    - “Arizona College of Nursing, LLC” → “Arizona College of Nursing, LLC” (do not remove the comma).\n    - “ANNABELS CLINIC LLC” → “Annabels Clinic LLC” (no comma if none in source).\n  - Keep entity suffix abbreviations in standard abbreviated form with periods where customary as presented:\n    - “Inc.”, “Corp.”, “Co.”, “Ltd.” (with periods)\n    - For partnership/LLC forms, preserve periods if present in the source (e.g., “L.L.C.” vs “LLC”; “L.P.” vs “LP”).\n- Remove jurisdictional/legal descriptors that are not part of the legal name:\n  - Strip phrases like “a Delaware limited liability company,” “a California corporation,” “an individual,” etc.\n- Remove personal credentials/honorifics internal to a name while preserving entity suffix punctuation:\n  - Remove credentials such as DDS, D.D.S., MD, M.D., DO, J.D., LL.M., PhD/Ph.D., MBA, CPA, RN, Esq., etc., if they appear within or immediately after a person’s name.\n  - Do not remove or alter the corporate/LLC/LP suffix or the comma immediately preceding it.\n  - Example: “LAWRENCE K. FUNG, DDS, INC.” → “Lawrence K. Fung, Inc.”\n- OCR noise:\n  - Clean up extra spaces and trailing punctuation. Remove trailing commas and superfluous punctuation at the end of the name, but do not remove an internal comma before the entity suffix.\n- Multiple lessees:\n  - If multiple co-tenants/lessees/licensees/subtenants are clearly listed, return all legal names separated by a semicolon and a space (“; ”) in the order they appear.\n\nHeuristic search order and tie-breakers\n- Prefer the exact legal name string as defined in the opening “by and between” recital (or equivalent definition), including its original internal punctuation adjacent to the suffix (e.g., comma before “LLC”).\n- If the opening recital is ambiguous or absent, use the signature block’s “TENANT/LESSEE/LICENSEE/SUBTENANT” line.\n- Ignore “Tenant’s Trade Name” or trade name references when a legal entity name is provided. Do not substitute the trade name for the legal entity.\n- In contexts where multiple related documents are included (e.g., a Guaranty of Lease and a Lease), extract the lessee from the Lease/Sublease/License (not from the Guaranty).\n\nEdge cases\n- Subleases: If the document is clearly a sublease and defines “Subtenant,” return the Subtenant.\n- Licenses: Return the Licensee.\n- Commencement/possession letters and estoppels: You may confirm the tenant name but should favor the original Lease’s defined party if there is any discrepancy.\n- All caps names: Convert to Title Case per the rules.\n\nOutput format\n- Return only the normalized legal name string(s), with no quotes, labels, or extra text.\n\nExamples\n- “THIS LEASE … by and between CSPB AUSTRALIAN LLC (‘Landlord’) and ANNABELS CLINIC LLC (‘Tenant’)” → “Annabels Clinic LLC”\n- “This Lease … between CRP PACIFICA PLAZA SPE, L.L.C. (‘Landlord’) and LAWRENCE K. FUNG, DDS, INC., a California professional corporation (‘Tenant’)” → “Lawrence K. Fung, Inc.”\n- “THIS LEASE … by and between PRISA ARBOR LAKES LLC (‘Landlord’) and CLAW CITY, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (‘Tenant’)” → “Claw City, LLC”\n- “This Space Usage Agreement … between Flax Pond LLC (‘Licensor’) and Body Barn LLC (‘Licensee’)” → “Body Barn LLC”",
