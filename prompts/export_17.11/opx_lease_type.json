  "instructions": "You are given a single input field:\n- document_text: the full text (often OCR’d) of a commercial lease or related documents (retail/industrial/office).\n\nYour task is to produce exactly one output field:\n- opx_lease_type: one of NNN, Full Service Gross, Modified Gross, Gross, or Exempt\n\nGeneral approach:\n- Read for explicit expense-responsibility signals. Many inputs are partial (rent rolls, amendments, exhibits) and OCR may be noisy. Use robust keyword scanning and context.\n- Prioritize clear structures over labels. “Additional Rent” alone does not decide type; focus on whether Operating Expenses/CAM/Taxes/Insurance are charged from dollar one vs increases over a Base Year/expense stop vs fully included.\n- Some datasets label office Base Year structures as “Full Service Gross” (FSG). Prefer “Full Service Gross” rather than “Modified Gross” when a Base Year/expense stop structure is present (especially in office leases) even if the lease is called “full service” or includes some separately billed items like overtime HVAC.\n\nDecision rules (apply in order; return only the label word(s), no punctuation or explanation):\n\n0) Exempt if any of the following apply:\n   - The document is not a lease or a lease amendment with expense-responsibility terms (e.g., rent roll, estoppel, SNDA/subordination, OFAC/W-9, notices, work letters only, abstract/summaries) or contains no discernible expense language.\n   - You cannot locate any clear expense-responsibility structure (no CAM/Operating Expenses, Taxes, Insurance, Base Year/expense stop) and the content is insufficient to classify.\n   Notes:\n   • Example: A rent roll with columns like “Cost Recovery” but no lease text → Exempt.\n   • Do not guess “Gross/NNN/Modified Gross” just from rent rates or percentage rent alone.\n\n1) NNN (triple-net) if any of the following are present:\n   - Explicit net language: “net,” “NNN,” “triple-net,” “net net net,” “absolute net,” “intended to be a net lease.”\n   - Pass-throughs from dollar one: Tenant pays its Proportionate Share (or similar) of Operating Costs/Operating Expenses/CAM with no Base Year/expense stop and also pays real estate/property taxes and insurance (in whole or pro-rata) in addition to base/minimum rent.\n   - Additional Rent with monthly estimates and year-end reconciliation for CAM/Operating Expenses plus Taxes and Insurance, not limited to increases over a Base Year.\n   - Strong indicator: A rent breakdown or “Initial Monthly Payment” listing Base/Minimum Rent plus separate line items for Taxes, Insurance, and CAM/Operating Costs; or amendments fixing CAM/insurance/marketing/tax charges per sf with no Base Year.\n   - Utilities/maintenance: Tenant pays most utilities (direct, submetered, or billed) and has broad maintenance obligations; no Base Year governs Operating Costs.\n\n2) Full Service Gross if any of the following are present:\n   - Base Year/expense stop structure: Tenant pays increases in Operating/Direct Costs and/or Property Taxes over a stated Base Year/Base Amount/expense stop (e.g., “Tenant’s Percentage Share of Excess Operating Expenses” and “Excess Property Taxes”) with estimates and reconciliation.\n   - Office “full service” structures where rent includes a Base Year of Operating/Direct Costs, with pass-throughs limited to increases, even if certain items (e.g., overtime HVAC, extra cleaning, separately metered utilities) are billed separately.\n   - Mixed categories with Base Year: If the lease defines “Operating Expenses” subject to a Base Year and some always-billable items, this is still Full Service Gross if the primary OpEx recovery is via a Base Year/increase mechanism.\n   - Tie-breaker: If both NNN-style provisions and Base Year language appear, classify as Full Service Gross when Operating Costs/Taxes are tied to a Base Year (tenant pays increases rather than full pro-rata from dollar one).\n\n3) Modified Gross if:\n   - The tenant pays some building expenses or specified categories above a base or “stop” but the structure is not a classic office “full service” Base Year (e.g., non-office settings with an expense stop, or increases over a fixed base amount limited to certain items), and it is not clearly NNN or fully Gross. Use this when increases-over-base exist but the context is not an office full-service model.\n   - Note: In many office leases with Base Year, prefer “Full Service Gross” (see rule 2).\n\n4) Gross only if ALL are true:\n   - Fixed rent expressly includes all Operating Costs/CAM, real estate taxes, property insurance, and normal-operations utilities.\n   - No material ongoing pass-throughs or reimbursements: no Base Year/expense stop, no Additional Rent for OpEx/Taxes/Insurance, no monthly estimates and reconciliation.\n   - Any extras are purely optional or extraordinary (e.g., after-hours HVAC, elective services).\n\nAdditional guidance:\n- Search targets (case-insensitive): “Additional Rent,” “Operating Costs/Expenses,” “CAM,” “Common Area Maintenance,” “Taxes,” “Real Estate Taxes,” “Insurance,” “Insurance Costs,” “Utilities,” “Submetered,” “Base Year,” “Expense Stop,” “Direct Costs,” “Escalations,” “Proportionate Share,” “Exhibit E Additional Rent.”\n- Percentage Rent does not determine lease type.\n- Office Base Year examples: Basic Lease Provisions with “Base Year: 2022” and clauses like “Tenant’s Percentage Share of Excess Operating Expenses and Excess Property Taxes” (with Exhibit E detailing Base Year, Excess calculations, and reconciliation) → Full Service Gross.\n- Retail/industrial: If taxes, insurance, CAM/Operating Costs are charged from dollar one (even as fixed per-sf charges or listed as separate line items), classify as NNN.\n\nSparse/partial document heuristics:\n- If the content appears to be only ancillary (rent rolls, notices, etc.) or lacks any expense-responsibility indicators, return Exempt.\n- Do not default to NNN solely due to lack of Base Year language when the document is not a lease or is too incomplete to assess.\n\nOutput format requirement:\n- Return exactly one of: NNN, Full Service Gross, Modified Gross, Gross, Exempt\n- No extra words, punctuation, or explanation.",
