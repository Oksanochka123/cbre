  "instructions": "Task: From the provided document_text, return the citation for the lease’s holdover/holding‑over clause location (not the clause text).\n\nWhat to return (single line only, no quotes or extra text):\n- Return the most specific identifier that pinpoints where the Holdover/Holding Over clause is located, using these rules in order of precedence:\n  1) If the clause heading itself (or the clearly labeled “Holdover/Holding Over” portion) is a lettered/numbered subparagraph within a numbered section (e.g., “28.(c) Holdover” with sub‑items “(i) …”), return the full pinpoint exactly as shown, including all nested levels and punctuation (e.g., 28.(c)i.). Do not prepend “Section”.\n  2) Else, if the clause is its own numbered section/article (e.g., “26. HOLDING OVER”, “Article 35 – Holding Over”, “Section 13.2 Holdover”), return “Section <number>” (use the exact number and any decimals as shown; if it says Article 35, normalize to “Section 35”).\n     - If a page number is visible in the extract near the section heading (e.g., “[Page 21]”), append “, page <number>” and prefix with “Lease, ” to match: “Lease, Section <number>, page <number>”.\n  3) If the clause heading is a standalone lettered subparagraph under a broader section and no numeric mapping is visible (e.g., “G. HOLDING OVER”), return ONLY the letter (e.g., G).\n  4) If the clause heading “Holding Over” (or variant) appears in the lease but has no visible number/letter and there is no clear mapping from a table of contents, return: Lease.\n  5) If the clause is only found (and numbered) in a later amendment (and not in the original lease), return “Section <number>” from that amendment (no prefixes).\n  6) If you cannot find any holdover/holding‑over clause anywhere in the provided text, return: Unknown.\n\nFormatting and specificity:\n- Preserve the exact structure, casing, parentheses, and punctuation of subparagraph identifiers (e.g., “28.(c)i.” vs “28.(C)i.”) exactly as shown in the document.\n- Use decimals if present (e.g., “Section 13.2”).\n- Do not add any prefixes like “Orig Lease Sec …”.\n- Output must be a single line containing only the citation string (e.g., 28.(c)i., Section 16, Lease, Section 26, page 21, G, Lease, Unknown).\n\nHow to find it:\n1) Identify the governing lease document first (original/initial lease agreement). Then check amendments only if the clause appears there and not in the original.\n2) Search for headings or TOC entries using variants: “Holding Over”, “Holdover”, “Holding‑Over”, “Holdover Tenancy”, “Hold over”.\n3) Acceptable sources for the identifier:\n   - The clause heading itself (e.g., “26. HOLDING OVER”, “28.(c) Holdover”, “Section 13.2 Holdover”).\n   - A table of contents that clearly maps “Holding Over” to a specific section/article number (then confirm in body if possible).\n4) Normalization and precedence:\n   - Prefer the most specific pin cite (e.g., subparagraph like 28.(c)i.) over a broader section number when the holdover heading is at that sub‑level.\n   - If only a broad section heading exists, return “Section <number>” (optionally with “Lease, …, page <n>” when a page tag is visible as described above).\n   - If only a standalone letter subparagraph is shown for “Holding Over” and no numeric mapping is visible, return the letter only.\n\nExamples of correct outputs:\n- Clause heading is “28.(c) Holdover” and the operative sub‑item is “(i)”: 28.(c)i.\n- Clause heading is “26. HOLDING OVER” and a page tag “[Page 21]” is shown: Lease, Section 26, page 21\n- Clause heading is “Section 16 Holding Over”: Section 16\n- Clause heading is “G. HOLDING OVER”: G\n- Unnumbered “Holding Over.” with no TOC mapping: Lease\n- No holdover clause found anywhere: Unknown",
