  "instructions": "Task overview\n- Input: A single field named document_text that may contain one or more documents (e.g., leases, exhibits, reports, filenames).\n- Output: A single field named property_name containing the proper name of the property.\n\nWhat to extract (priority and preferences)\n- Return the named property, project, complex, or building identifier used by the landlord/lease, not the postal address and not the tenant/landlord company name.\n- Prefer the branded Project/park/center/campus name (e.g., “Activity Business Center”, “Mayhill 380 Business Park”). If a building identifier is clearly part of the identification, append it as “Bldg X”.\n- If no branded Project/park/center name exists, prefer a landlord/portfolio property identifier that appears in titles/headers/filenames (see Portfolio identifier rule below).\n- Avoid street addresses as the property_name. Use a postal address only as an absolute last resort.\n\nWhere to find it (search in this order)\n1) Lease “Basic Provisions” or similar, especially:\n   - “the building commonly known as …”\n   - “Premises … commonly known as …”\n   - “located within the … [Name] …”\n   - Definitions of “Project” or captions of exhibits (“Exhibit B: Description of the Land”, “Exhibit C: Site Plan”) that contain a branded park/center name.\n2) Document filenames/headers/cover pages that contain a project/park/center or portfolio property identifier (e.g., “(Mayhill 380 Business Park)”, or an owner-coded label like “Sprague Owner LLC -65”).\n3) Other clear references in the lease body that denote a branded property/complex name or a consistent portfolio label used by the owner/landlord.\n\nSelection rules\n- If the text states the space is “located within the [Name] [descriptor]” and the descriptor is part of the branded name (e.g., “Business Center”, “Business Park”), include it (e.g., “Activity Business Center”).\n- If it is a branded proper-noun phrase followed by a generic descriptor (e.g., “Business Center”), still capture the full proper-noun phrase (e.g., “Activity Business Center”).\n- If a building identifier is explicitly part of the common name or clearly specified (e.g., “Building 3”), append it as “Bldg 3”.\n- If multiple candidates appear, prefer the broader, branded Project/campus/park/center name. Include the building tag only if stated (e.g., “[Project Name] Bldg X”).\n- Do not append “Addition”, plat/legal description terms, counties, or legal qualifiers to the property name.\n\nPortfolio identifier rule (use when no branded property name is present)\n- When the lease does NOT provide a branded project/park/center name, look for a landlord/portfolio property identifier in document titles, headers/footers, or filenames. These often pair the owner entity with a numeric or short code (e.g., “Sprague Owner LLC -65”, “ABC REIT – Bldg 4”).\n- If such a portfolio identifier is clearly used as the property label in the document (e.g., on the cover, header, or filename) and no branded property name exists, return that identifier exactly as the property_name, even if it includes the owner entity.\n- Normalization guidance:\n  - Preserve the capitalization of the identifier as shown.\n  - If the title/header pairs the owner entity with a street number (e.g., “SPRAGUE OWNER LLC LEASE — 65 SPRAGUE STREET”) and no other property name is available, normalize to “[Owner Entity] -[Street Number]” (e.g., “Sprague Owner LLC -65”). Do not include street words (Street, Ave, Rd) or city/state.\n  - If the portfolio identifier includes a building tag, normalize “Building” to “Bldg” (e.g., “XYZ REIT – Building 4” → “XYZ REIT - Bldg 4”).\n- Only use a landlord/tenant name as part of property_name when it is integral to a clearly designated portfolio identifier used by the document as the property label. Otherwise, do not return landlord/tenant names.\n\nAddress handling and fallbacks\n- Treat phrases like “the building located at and commonly known as [address]” as an address reference, not a property name. Continue searching for a branded name or portfolio identifier.\n- Do not return a postal address (e.g., “65 Sprague Street”) as the property_name unless no named property/complex, no building common name, and no portfolio identifier can be determined. Addresses are last resort and generally undesirable.\n- If no Project/park/center name and no portfolio identifier can be found, use the building’s common name if it is a true name (not just a street address). If the only “common name” is an address, do not use it unless absolutely nothing else is available.\n\nFormatting rules\n- Output only the property name string; no extra commentary or fields.\n- Do not include any street address components, suite numbers, city/state/ZIP.\n- Use plain ASCII characters (no en dashes).\n- If including a building tag, use “Bldg” (e.g., “Bldg 3”) rather than “Building”.\n- Preserve the capitalization of the branded name or portfolio identifier.\n- If “Business Park” is explicitly part of the name, include it. If an abbreviated form is clearly the standard in the document, you may use that; otherwise keep “Business Park” as written.\n\nExamples\n- “approximately 1,994 square foot office space located within the Activity Business Center business park” → property_name: “Activity Business Center”.\n- “building commonly known as Mayhill 380 – Building 3” and elsewhere “Mayhill 380 Business Park” → property_name: “Mayhill 380 Business Park Bldg 3”.\n- No branded name found; cover/header shows “SPRAGUE OWNER LLC LEASE — 65 SPRAGUE STREET”; no other property identifier → normalize to portfolio label “Sprague Owner LLC -65”.\n\nExclusions\n- Ignore OFAC reports, transaction summaries, or unrelated documents unless they contain the lease’s property name/identifier.\n- Do not include tenant/guarantor/broker names unless they are integral to the property’s portfolio identifier as described above.\n\nProcedure (quick checklist)\n1) Scan Basic Provisions and definitions of Premises/Project for a branded property/park/center name (and any building number to append as “Bldg X”).\n2) If none, scan the document filename/title/header/footer for a portfolio property identifier (owner entity paired with a numeric/code). If found, return it (normalized per the Portfolio identifier rule).\n3) If none, scan exhibits/site plans for a branded property/complex name.\n4) If none, use a building common name (true name, not an address). Avoid addresses.\n5) Only as a last resort, use the postal address (undesired).\n\nOutput\n- Return a single line string for property_name following the above rules.",
