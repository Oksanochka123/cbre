  "instructions": "You are given document_text for a commercial real estate lease package and must output a single string field: premise_address.\n\nYour goal\n- Return the leased Premises’ street address line, in a single line, including the unit/suite/space identifier (and floor/level and/or building number if explicitly part of the Premises designation), and nothing else.\n- Do not add city, state, ZIP, center/building names, tenant names, or any context not found in the text.\n- The output must be exactly one string; no explanations or quotes.\n\nWhere to find it (search thoroughly)\n- Read the entire package. The address can appear in many places:\n  - Cover page, caption blocks, “Summary/Basic Lease Information,” “Premises/Building,” or “located at/addressed at” lines.\n  - Premises descriptions and exhibits (Exhibit A/B), floor plan or site plan title blocks, headers/footers labeling the project address.\n  - Executed amendments, estoppels, consents to sublease/assignment, subleases, memoranda of lease, or later-dated letters.\n  - Signature blocks or notice sections that explicitly label “Premises” or “Premises address” (avoid general corporate mailing addresses unless clearly the Premises).\n- For inline retail in shopping centers/malls: the premises address is the center’s street address plus the specific space/suite identifier. If only a space number is given with the center name, locate the center’s street address elsewhere in the package (e.g., site plan or amendment title blocks, consents) and combine them.\n\nSelection rules and precedence\n- Choose the instance most explicitly tied to the Premises/Building (“Premises located at …”, “Premises: …”, “addressed at …”). It is acceptable to pair a building street line with a separately stated Premises suite/space/floor identifier when both are clearly for the same Premises.\n- If multiple instances conflict, prefer the latest dated executed document (amendments/estoppels > original lease).\n- Prefer an instance that includes the unit identifier (suite/space) over one that does not. If no instance ties the unit to the street line, select the best street line for the Premises and append the clearly identified unit for that Premises.\n- If the building’s “mailing address” (postal street line) is provided alongside the Premises suite/space/floor within that building, you may combine them.\n- Inline retail/shopping center specifics:\n  - Combine the center’s postal street line with the tenant’s specific space/suite identifier.\n  - Search the package for the exact postal street line variant for the center, including any pre-street directional (e.g., W., E., North) and the preferred street suffix form; use the variant shown in an authoritative instance (cover/basic info/exhibit title block/notice sections/recorded docs).\n  - If the space identifier appears in multiple forms (e.g., “Unit No. 152”, “Space 152”, or just “113”), use the form and number that is most consistently used for the Premises across executed documents, exhibits, or repeated labels. If the authoritative instance uses a bare number (e.g., “113”) without a label, you may output the bare number after the comma.\n- Special case for branded numeric property names that also function as the street address line (e.g., “100 Biscayne”):\n  - If an authoritative Premises/Building designation presents the street portion in that shortened form as the address (e.g., in Basic Lease Information or exhibit title blocks) and it is used to identify the Premises, you may use that exact form as the street portion (do not expand to “Boulevard” or add directionals unless that form appears in an authoritative address instance for the Premises).\n- Ignore legal land descriptions (metes and bounds) and P.O. Boxes.\n- Do not use tenant or landlord corporate mailing addresses unless they explicitly identify the Premises location or are clearly the Premises’ postal address in the notice section for that tenant suite.\n\nFormatting rules\n- Output only the street portion followed by the unit/suite/space/floor portion, in this form:\n  “<street number/name as shown>[ optional building suffix like ‘Bldg #<n>’], <unit label or identifier>[, <floor/level label>]”\n  Examples:\n    - “700 S. Flower Street, Suite 860”\n    - “2807 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 220”\n    - “1501 Mayhill Drive Bldg #3, Suite 210”\n    - “6101 W. Centinela Avenue, Suite 375, Floor 3”\n    - For shopping center spaces where only a number is used: “3650 W. Martin Luther King Boulevard, 113”\n- City/state/ZIP must NOT be included.\n- Use a single comma and space between the street portion and the unit/floor portion. If both a unit and floor are present, separate them with “, ” and preserve their labels/order (e.g., “Suite 375, Floor 3”).\n- Preserve directionals and punctuation as shown (e.g., “W”, “E”, “S.”, “NE”). If both “pre-street” and “post-suffix” directional variants exist, prefer the standard pre-street directional form if an authoritative instance provides it.\n- Street suffix preference: if any authoritative instance provides a fully spelled-out suffix (Road, Avenue, Street, Boulevard, Drive, Lane, Place, Court, Circle, Parkway), use the spelled-out form. If only abbreviated forms (Rd, Ave, Blvd) appear, keep the abbreviation as shown.\n- Unit/suite/space label:\n  - Preserve the unit label exactly as it appears in the selected authoritative instance (“Suite 210”, “Ste 116”, “Unit No. 12”, “Space 1530”). Do not convert labels unless composing is necessary.\n  - If you must compose from a street line without a unit and a separate clearly labeled suite/space for the same Premises, append the unit as it is labeled (e.g., “, Suite <identifier>”). For inline retail where the unit is shown only as a number (e.g., “113”), you may append just the number (no label) if that is how the Premises is identified in authoritative materials.\n- Building number: if “Building 3”/“Bldg 3” is explicitly part of the Premises designation with a street address, append “ Bldg #3” to the street portion (before the comma).\n- Floor/level: if the Premises are explicitly tied to a floor/level (e.g., “on the third floor”, “Level 2”, “Fl 3”, “3rd Floor”), append a floor/level label after the unit/space, preserving the label (“Floor 3”, “Level 2”, “Fl 3”). If the floor is stated in words only (e.g., “third floor”), convert to “Floor <number>”.\n- Directionals: include a pre-street directional if an authoritative instance includes it for the chosen street address. Do not invent or move a directional if no instance supplies it.\n\nConflict resolution and normalization\n- If multiple variants of the same address appear (e.g., “Rd.” vs “Road”, “Australian Avenue South” vs “South Australian Avenue”), prefer:\n  1) The instance explicitly tied to Premises/Building/“located at/addressed at.”\n  2) The later-dated executed document (amendments/estoppels).\n  3) The variant with a fully spelled-out street suffix and, when both forms exist, the standard pre-street directional.\n- Do not over-normalize: once you select an authoritative street line form for the Premises (e.g., a branded shorthand like “100 Biscayne”), keep that form; do not expand it to a different variant unless a more authoritative Premises instance shows the expanded form for the same Premises.\n\nOutput\n- Return only the premise_address string, with no extra characters, quotes, or commentary.\n- If, after a thorough search, no street address for the Premises appears anywhere in the provided text, return an empty string.",
