  "instructions": "You are given a single free-form document_text that can contain one or more documents (e.g., leases, amendments, renewals, work letters, exhibits, estoppels, OFAC/compliance reports). Your task is to extract and return first_occupied — a single date (YYYY-MM-DD) that represents the tenant’s first date of occupancy/possession for the applicable lease relationship.\n\nKey definitions\n- first_occupied: The earliest date the named Tenant in the packet was permitted to occupy or take possession of the premises under the applicable lease relationship.\n- Lease relationship: A set of documents that pertain to the same Premises (address + suite). An “Original Lease” and its amendments/renewals for the SAME suite/premises comprise one relationship. A “New Lease” or a lease for a different suite/premises, even within the same project, is a separate lease relationship.\n\nWhat to parse vs ignore\n- Relevant: Leases, lease amendments, extensions/renewals, work letters, estoppels, and exhibits that define commencement/possession/ready/delivery. Also office/retail leases (e.g., AIR CRE) that define “Commencement Date,” “Start Date,” “Outside Commencement Date,” etc.\n- Irrelevant: Compliance/watchlist/OFAC/BIS reports, purely administrative cover pages, or exhibits without occupancy/possession content.\n\nGrouping and choosing the applicable lease relationship (critical for multi-document inputs)\n1) Group documents by Premises (address + suite). Treat each unique suite as its own lease relationship.\n2) If the packet clearly includes a “New Lease” for a different suite/premises than older documents, treat that “New Lease” as a NEW lease relationship; do NOT carry dates from an older relationship.\n3) If multiple relationships are present with different suites:\n   - Prefer the lease relationship that is clearly the focus of the packet (e.g., a “New Lease,” latest fully executed lease, or the one with an upcoming/current term).\n   - If unclear, choose the relationship with the most recent fully executed lease (newest lease), not an older, expired relationship.\n4) Within a single lease relationship (same premises): first_occupied refers to the original occupancy/possession start for the current named Tenant under that relationship. If the current Tenant gained rights by assignment from a prior tenant, use the earliest date the current Tenant (assignee) was permitted to occupy (e.g., assignment effective date or the amended term’s commencement date that first applies to the assignee), NOT the original prior tenant’s commencement date.\n\nSpecial handling: Assignments and Tenant changes\n- If the packet identifies the Tenant as an assignee (e.g., “Tenant, as assignee of [Prior Tenant]”) or otherwise shows a change in tenant, first_occupied must be the earliest date the current named Tenant (assignee) could occupy, even if the prior tenant occupied earlier.\n- Use an explicit assignment effective date if provided. If not, use the first Commencement/Start/Delivery/Term start date that applies to the assignee (often stated in the amendment/extension that recognizes the assignment).\n- Do not use a prior tenant’s original commencement date for first_occupied of the current Tenant.\n\nPriority order for determining first_occupied (use the earliest applicable that yields a concrete calendar date)\n1) Explicit Early Possession Date (only if given as a specific calendar date) that grants actual possession/occupancy (even if non-exclusive). If earlier than commencement, use this.\n   - Do NOT treat “possession/access to commence pre-occupancy Tenant Work,” installation access, or similar construction access as occupancy. Ignore such access unless a specific calendar Early Possession Date is stated and it clearly confers occupancy rights.\n   - Do NOT compute an early possession date from vague rules (e.g., “upon execution,” “two business days after execution”) unless a specific date is explicitly provided AND it confers occupancy (not just construction access).\n2) Explicit Commencement Date / Lease Commencement Date / Start Date specified as a calendar date. Use the earliest such date that confers occupancy.\n   - If later amendments/estoppels explicitly reset or set the Commencement Date, the most recent controlling document’s explicit Commencement Date governs. Prefer a later amendment’s explicit Commencement Date over earlier estimates, “not later than” statements, or contingent formulas.\n3) Explicit Delivery of Possession / Delivery Date / Ready for Occupancy date specified as a calendar date, when defined as the date the tenant can occupy.\n4) Computable rule (no explicit date, but the doc provides a formula):\n   - Compute the date from the referenced base (e.g., “45 days after Date of this Lease”).\n   - If the computed/explicit commencement falls mid-month AND the lease states the first partial month will be prorated, set first_occupied to the first day of the next calendar month; otherwise, use the computed/explicit date.\n   - This proration normalization applies to commencement/start dates and computed dates only when such rent proration language exists.\n5) If only a Lease “Date” (execution/reference date) is available, and there is no separate commencement/possession/ready date:\n   - For an initial lease (not an amendment), use the Lease Date.\n   - For amendments/renewals, do NOT use the amendment’s Effective Date as first_occupied. Instead, use the original occupancy start for the current Tenant per rules above (e.g., assignment effective date or the original lease’s date if the same Tenant and same premises).\n6) Rent Commencement Date: Use only if no earlier possession/commencement/ready date is available, recognizing rent commencement can be later than occupancy due to free rent.\n\nConflict resolution and document precedence\n- If multiple documents provide different commencement/possession dates:\n  - Prefer a later amendment that explicitly sets (not estimates) a Commencement Date for the applicable relationship/tenant over earlier references or estimates.\n  - Estoppel certificates can be used if they specify a concrete Commencement Date; do not rely on “not later than” or general “in possession” statements without a specific date to override a later amendment with a specific date.\n  - Recitals are informative but can be superseded by operative language in later amendments.\n- Do not derive first_occupied from unrelated documents (e.g., OFAC/credit/compliance reports).\n\nSpecial handling and cautions\n- Early access for construction: Language granting access “to commence pre-occupancy Tenant Work,” installation of furniture/fixtures, or similar is not occupancy/possession; ignore for first_occupied unless a specific calendar Early Possession Date clearly grants occupancy rights.\n- “Start Date” defined as earlier of Commencement or Early Possession:\n  - Use “Start Date” if a specific date is provided AND it confers occupancy (not just construction access).\n- Amendments/Renewals: Within the SAME lease relationship and same Tenant:\n  - If the Tenant has been continuous since the original lease, use the original occupancy date unless a later amendment explicitly resets the Commencement Date (e.g., due to construction delays). The explicit reset in the latest amendment controls.\n  - If the Tenant changed via assignment, use the earliest occupancy date applicable to the current Tenant per the assignment/amendment, not the prior tenant’s original date.\n- Multiple suites/premises in one packet:\n  - Group by suite and determine first_occupied per group.\n  - If a “New Lease” appears for a different suite, treat it as a new relationship and select first_occupied from that new relationship (usually the explicit Commencement Date or earlier valid possession date).\n  - Prefer the most recent relationship (e.g., the newest “New Lease”) if focus is unclear.\n\nDate parsing and output\n- Normalize to ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.\n- Resolve abbreviated/partial years (e.g., “October 16 ’23” => 2023-10-16).\n- If the document states “on or before,” “not later than,” or another non-specific bound, do NOT guess; prefer a later explicit date set in an amendment/estoppel. If no explicit date is ever given, use the earliest concrete date you can compute per the rules.\n- Output ONLY the date string, with no extra text.\n\nCommon patterns and tips\n- AIR CRE leases: “Basic Provisions 1.3” often sets Commencement Date; “1.4 Early Possession” is often conditional access for build-out (not occupancy). “Start Date” can be defined as earlier of Commencement or Early Possession. Check rent proration language for mid-month normalization.\n- Work Letters: Often define “Substantial Completion” and “Ready for Occupancy”; only use if tied to a specific calendar date and grants possession.\n- Estoppels: Can confirm a concrete Commencement Date; “not later than” or “in possession” without a date is not a substitute for a later amendment’s explicit date.\n- Assignment language: “Tenant, as assignee of [X],” or recitals stating transfer/acceptance; then look for the first term commencement date applicable to the assignee.\n\nIf nothing suitable is found\n- Return the best-supported date per the hierarchy above for the applicable tenant and premises. Do not return placeholders or free text.\n\nYour output must be a single ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) and nothing else.",
