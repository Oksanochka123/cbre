  "instructions": "You are given a single input field:\n- document_text: OCR/extracted text from one or more real estate documents (may include multiple files/exhibits, page headers, table artifacts, etc.).\n\nYour task:\n- Produce a single field, insurance_required, with the value Yes or No (capitalized exactly) indicating whether the tenant/party is required to carry insurance in connection with the property/lease depicted in the document(s).\n\nKey guidance and domain heuristics:\n1) What qualifies as “insurance required”\n   - Any obligation in the materials for a tenant/occupant to maintain insurance of any kind (e.g., commercial general liability, property/all-risk, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, contractual liability, loss of income/extra expense, builder’s risk/Builder’s All Risk, auto liability), to name the landlord as additional insured, to provide certificates of insurance, or similar evidence → insurance_required = Yes.\n   - Any obligation for the landlord to maintain insurance (e.g., fire/special-form/replacement cost, CGL for Common Areas) also indicates insurance is expected under the lease structure → insurance_required = Yes.\n   - References that Additional Rent includes “Insurance,” “Taxes, Insurance and Operating Expenses,” cost-sharing of landlord’s insurance, or similar → insurance_required = Yes.\n   - Self-insurance options (e.g., if tangible net worth threshold is met) still imply an insurance requirement → Yes.\n\n2) Document types and default assumptions (be conservative and prefer Yes):\n   - Commercial leases and related documents (including: Lease, Amendment, Work Letter, Rules and Regulations, Guaranty, Commencement Agreement, Estoppel/Estoppel Certificate, SNDA/Subordination Non-Disturbance & Attornment, CDA/Commencement Date Agreement, Exhibits) almost always require insurance. Even if a particular file within the set does not restate the insurance article, the underlying lease requires it → insurance_required = Yes.\n   - Rent Rolls for commercial properties: label insurance_required = Yes. (These are property/tenancy artifacts where standard leases require insurance even if the rent roll itself doesn’t mention insurance.)\n   - Only answer No if the document explicitly and clearly states that no insurance is required, or if it’s unmistakably unrelated to any lease/tenancy/property insurance context (rare in this dataset).\n\n3) Phrases/clauses strongly indicating insurance requirements:\n   - “Insurance” article/section headings; “Tenant shall maintain commercial general liability insurance” (e.g., $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate; $2M/$3M in some docs), “Workers’ Compensation,” “Employer’s Liability,” “All risk/Special Causes of Loss,” “replacement cost,” “Builder’s All Risk,” “loss of income/extra expense,” “contractual liability.”\n   - “Landlord shall maintain fire insurance/special form/replacement cost,” “Landlord shall maintain commercial general liability.”\n   - “Additional insured,” “waiver of subrogation,” “AM Best A-VII,” “certificate of insurance,” “notice of cancellation,” “self-insurance,” “captive,” “blanket policy.”\n\n4) No need for explanations:\n   - Output only the value Yes or No (exact capitalization). Do not include reasoning, keys, or extra text.\n\n5) Noise tolerance:\n   - The text may contain page artifacts, repeated headers/footers, or multiple embedded documents. Scan holistically—if any part implies insurance is required under the lease/property, answer Yes.\n\nDecision rule summary:\n- If you find any explicit insurance obligation (tenant or landlord): Yes.\n- If the document is any commercial lease-related doc (lease, amendment, estoppel, SNDA, guaranty, commencement agreement, work letter, rent roll): default to Yes unless it explicitly says no insurance is required.\n- Only answer No if the document clearly disclaims any insurance requirement and is not otherwise part of a commercial lease package.\n\nOutput format:\n- Exactly one token: Yes or No.",
