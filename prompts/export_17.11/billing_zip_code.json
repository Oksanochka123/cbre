  "instructions": "You will receive a single input field called document_text that may contain one or more leases, amendments, estoppels, letters, lease profiles, license/space use agreements, or related real estate documents bundled together. Your task is to extract and return the tenant’s billing ZIP code as exactly 5 digits (US ZIP), with no other characters or text.\n\nDefinition:\n- billing_zip_code = the 5-digit ZIP code associated with the tenant’s primary mailing/billing address. This is typically the address listed for the tenant in:\n  - the lease parties block/preamble,\n  - the Basic Lease Information “Tenant’s Address,”\n  - the Notices section (“Tenant’s Notice Address,” “AS TO TENANT,” etc.),\n  - correspondence addressed to the tenant (e.g., “To:” lines on letters/notices),\n  - estoppels stating “Tenant’s current address for notices,”\n  - lease profiles showing “Bill To” or “Tenant Address.”\n\nOrder of precedence (choose the first applicable):\n1) A specific “Billing” address for the tenant anywhere in the document set (including “Bill To” in profiles) — return that ZIP.\n2) Tenant’s Notice address:\n   - Prefer any “From/After Commencement Date,” “from and after the Commencement Date,” “upon Lessee’s taking possession the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for notice,” or similar wording over “Before Commencement” or pre-Commencement addresses.\n   - If the notice section lists an external address AND also states notices shall be at “the Premises” (e.g., “and also at the Demised Premises after the Commencement Date”), use the Premises/Building address ZIP (not the external address).\n   - If “After Commencement” notice address is “The Premises” without a ZIP on that line, derive the ZIP from the Premises/Building address elsewhere in the document.\n3) The tenant’s primary address in the lease parties preamble/signature block or the Basic Lease Information “Tenant’s Address.”\n4) A letter, mailing label, or notice in the document explicitly addressed “To:” the tenant (e.g., Notice of Lease Term Dates, transmittal letters) — use the tenant’s address ZIP.\n5) Estoppel certificates stating “Tenant’s current address for notices” or lease profiles showing the tenant’s mailing/Bill To address.\n\nFallbacks and special cases:\n- If this is a license/space usage/short-form agreement and NO tenant mailing/notice/billing address is present anywhere, and the only postal address present is the Premises/Building, return the Premises/Building ZIP as the tenant ZIP.\n- When a Notices section lists both “Before Commencement Date” and “From/After Commencement Date,” prefer the “From/After Commencement” address. If “From/After Commencement” is stated as “The Premises,” use the Premises/Building ZIP.\n- If a ZIP+4 appears (e.g., 91915-1805), return only the first 5 digits (91915).\n\nWhat to avoid (never return these ZIPs):\n- Landlord’s address, property owner/manager addresses, attorney addresses, broker addresses, or any “Remit to Lockbox”/payment remittance ZIPs (e.g., “Make checks payable to… Remit to Lockbox … Pasadena, CA 91185-4488”).\n- Bank/wire/remittance addresses.\n- “c/o” third-party lease administration addresses when a clear main tenant address is also provided, unless the document explicitly labels that “c/o” address as the tenant’s billing address.\n- The property’s physical location ZIP unless:\n  - the document explicitly sets the tenant’s notice address as “The Premises” after commencement (e.g., “and also at the Demised Premises after the Commencement Date,” “upon taking possession the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for notice”), OR\n  - it’s a license/space usage/short-form agreement (or similar) where no separate tenant address exists and the only address present is the Premises/Building (use this as a fallback).\n\nConflict resolution:\n- If multiple tenant addresses are present, prefer the Notice/Billing address per the precedence above.\n- Critically: If the Notices section provides both (a) an off-site address and (b) states that from/after the Commencement Date notices to the tenant are at “the Premises,” use the Premises ZIP (not the off-site address).\n- USPS labels and letters addressed to the tenant are usable if higher-priority sources are not definitive.\n- Estoppels indicating “Tenant’s current address for notices” are acceptable.\n\nFormatting rules:\n- Output exactly 5 digits. No spaces, hyphens, commas, words, or other characters.\n- If no tenant ZIP can be identified after applying the rules above, return an empty string.\n\nImplementation tips:\n- Scan for headings/phrases: “Tenant’s Address,” “Notices,” “Tenant’s Notice Address,” “AS TO TENANT,” “Billing,” “Bill To,” “To:” (on letters), “Tenant’s current address for notices,” as well as the lease parties preamble naming the tenant with an address.\n- Pay close attention to Notices sections that include language like “from/after the Commencement Date” or “upon Lessee’s taking possession the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for notice.” If present, choose the Premises ZIP even if another external address is listed.\n- Distinguish and exclude “Landlord’s Notice Address,” “Address for Landlord,” landlord’s/property manager’s addresses, and payment remittance/lockbox addresses.\n- Common ZIP patterns: a 5-digit number (optionally followed by “-” and 4 digits) at the end of a US city/state line (e.g., “Herndon, VA 20170”). Extract only the first 5 digits.\n\nExamples aligned with these rules:\n- Notices lists “AS TO TENANT: 500 Australian Avenue South, Suite 1010, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401” → 33401.\n- Notices lists a pre-commencement tenant address plus “and also at the Demised Premises after the Commencement Date,” and the Premises is “Two Wisconsin Circle, Chevy Chase, MD 20815” → 20815 (use the Premises ZIP for the after-commencement notice).\n- License/space usage agreement with no separate tenant address listed anywhere and the only address present is the Premises “3550 Frontier Ave, Boulder, CO 80301” → 80301 (fallback).\n- Avoid landlord remittance/lockbox: “DEPT LA 24488, Pasadena, CA 91185-4488” (do not return 91185).\n\nOutput:\n- Only the 5-digit ZIP code as plain text, nothing else.",
