  "instructions": "Task\n- Input: One field called document_text that may contain one or more related documents (e.g., lease, amendments, consent letters, exhibits).\n- Output: Return only the agreement’s expiration date as a single ISO 8601 calendar date string (YYYY-MM-DD). If a specific calendar date cannot be determined from the provided text, return an empty string.\n- Do not include any explanation or additional fields.\n\nDefinition of “expiration date” for this task\n- Return the end date of the initial fixed term of the agreement.\n- Ignore optional/elective renewal or extension options unless the document states the extension is automatic and already in effect.\n- If the document states the agreement will continue month-to-month after the initial term, return the end date of the initial term (do not return an open-ended or rolling date).\n- Special case: If the agreement is month-to-month from the outset (i.e., there is no separate fixed initial term), treat the “initial fixed term” as the first monthly rental period beginning on the Commencement Date. In that case, return the date one calendar month after the Commencement Date (clamped to the last day of the next month if needed). Example: Commencement 2021-03-03 → expiration 2021-04-03.\n\nWhat to search for\n- Headings/defined terms such as: Term, Initial Term, Commencement Date, Expiration Date, Initial Expiration Date, Termination Date, Lease Year, “period beginning … and ending …,” “ending on,” “last day of,” “tenth Lease Year,” etc.\n- Any “Fundamental/Principal Lease Provisions” or summary tables that define those terms.\n- Signatures or dates only to the extent the document ties them to defined triggers (e.g., Possession Date, Commencement).\n- If multiple documents are present in document_text (e.g., a consent letter plus a lease), prioritize the operative agreement (the lease/contract itself) over ancillary correspondence (consents, cover letters, memos). Use amendments only to the extent they set/replace the controlling term.\n\nPriority rules and conflicts\n- Use explicit “Expiration Date” or “period beginning … and ending …” when present.\n- If the expiration is defined via “Nth Lease Year,” use the document’s Lease Year definition (see computation rules below).\n- If an amendment modifies the expiration:\n  • If it states a new expiration (and that modification is executed—not merely an option) treat that new date as the end of the fixed term unless the text makes clear the extension is elective and not yet in effect.\n  • If both a “current expiration date” and a further-out “extended expiration date” are stated, and the extension will occur in the future (not yet commenced), prefer the current (in-effect) expiration when asked for the initial fixed term.\n- Do not use blank templates/memoranda or documents with unfilled placeholders to set dates.\n\nCommencement Date determination\n- Do not assume the effective date or any signature date is the Commencement Date unless the document explicitly says so.\n- If Commencement is defined by triggers (e.g., “earlier of opening for business or 150 days after the Possession Date”), prefer the computable trigger(s). Do not guess unknown trigger dates (e.g., unknown opening date).\n- If Possession Date is defined relative to signatures (e.g., “1 business day after the later of the parties’ signature dates”), compute:\n  • Identify the later signature date shown on signature blocks.\n  • Add one business day (Mon–Fri; ignore holidays unless specified).\n  • Then add the required number of days to reach Commencement.\n- If the document provides a specific expected Commencement Date and no other computation is available, you may use it.\n\nExpiration/term computation rules\n- If the term is “X years and Y months” after the Commencement Date, add that duration to the Commencement Date.\n- If the document says the term ends on “the last day of the month,” adjust the computed date to the last calendar day of that month.\n- If the expiration is “the last day of the Nth Lease Year,” use the Lease Year definition provided:\n  • Common pattern: If Commencement is not the first day of a calendar month, the first Lease Year runs from Commencement through the end of that calendar month plus the next 12 months. The Nth Lease Year ends on the last day of the corresponding month.\n  • If Commencement is the first day of a month, the Nth Lease Year typically ends on the last day of the prior month in year N (e.g., 2025-09-01 with a 10-year term → 2035-08-31).\n- Month-to-month handling:\n  • If an agreement is month-to-month from the start (no separate fixed initial term), set expiration to Commencement + 1 calendar month (same day number; if the next month lacks that day, use the last day of that next month).\n  • If the document states the agreement continues month-to-month after a fixed initial term, return the end date of that fixed initial term.\n- Always account for actual month lengths and leap years (e.g., February 29).\n- If the initial period is expressly stated as a fixed “beginning [date] and ending [date],” use the stated ending date, even if rent proration is also described.\n\nDocument selection and scope\n- Use the controlling agreement text within the provided document_text. If multiple documents are present:\n  • Prioritize the lease/contract itself (and any executed amendments that set the term) over consents, cover letters, or unrelated reports.\n  • If an amendment explicitly resets the expiration (already executed), that new date controls unless it is a not-yet-effective/optional future extension.\n- If the provided materials do not contain enough information to compute a specific calendar date (e.g., missing Commencement triggers and no explicit dates), return an empty string.\n\nOutput format\n- Return only the final expiration date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n- If not determinable, return an empty string.\n\nExamples (for reference of method; do not print these)\n- “Period beginning March 1, 2025 and ending on February 28, 2026” → 2026-02-28.\n- Commencement 2023-01-01; Primary Term 36 months; Termination is last day of last calendar month → 2025-12-31.\n- Month-to-month from the outset with Commencement 2021-03-03 → 2021-04-03.\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Do not use signature dates as Commencement unless the lease says so.\n- Do not rely on blank or template memoranda to set dates.\n- Do not output non-ISO formats, text, or explanations.\n- When an amendment lists both a current expiration and a future extended expiration, and the future extension is not yet in effect, return the current (in-effect) expiration for the initial fixed term.",
