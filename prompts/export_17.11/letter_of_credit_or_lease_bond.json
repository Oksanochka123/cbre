  "instructions": "You are given a single input field: document_text. It contains one or more real estate lease-related documents (e.g., a full lease, amendments, notices, possession letters, etc.). Your task is to output a single categorical value for the field letter_of_credit_or_lease_bond that indicates whether the lease’s required lease security instrument is a Letter of Credit, a Lease Bond, or neither.\n\nWhat to extract\n- Identify if the lease requires (or permits in lieu of a cash security deposit) either:\n  1) A Letter of Credit (LOC), or\n  2) A Lease Bond (i.e., a surety bond securing tenant’s obligations under the lease).\n- If neither applies, return None.\n\nStrict output format\n- Output exactly one of the following strings and nothing else:\n  - Letter of Credit\n  - Lease Bond\n  - None\n- Do not include explanations, citations, amounts, or any other text.\n\nDecision rules and synonyms\n1) Letter of Credit → output “Letter of Credit” if the lease:\n   - Requires tenant to provide a letter of credit; or\n   - Allows/requires the security deposit to be in the form of a (irrevocable/standby/evergreen) letter of credit; or\n   - Uses LOC-specific language (e.g., “letter of credit,” “LOC,” “irrevocable standby letter of credit,” “beneficiary,” “draw,” “sight draft,” “UCP 600,” “ISP98,” “issuing bank,” “evergreen”).\n   - Typical placement: Security Deposit section; stand-alone security exhibit/letter of credit exhibit; or a clause explicitly substituting LOC for cash deposit.\n\n2) Lease Bond → output “Lease Bond” if the lease:\n   - Requires a surety/lease/security deposit bond that secures tenant’s lease obligations; or\n   - Allows/requires the security deposit to be provided in the form of a bond (e.g., “lease bond,” “surety bond in lieu of security deposit,” “bond securing Tenant’s obligations under this Lease,” “security deposit bond,” “lease guaranty bond”).\n   - Typical language includes bond amount tied to rent/security deposit, requirement of an admitted surety, A.M. Best rating, bond form approval, and that the bond guarantees all tenant obligations under the lease.\n\n3) None → output “None” if:\n   - The documents only reference a cash Security Deposit and do not mention a letter of credit or a lease/ surety bond as the security instrument; or\n   - The only “bond” references are NOT lease security instruments (see “Do not count” below); or\n   - The document is a letter, memo, or notice that does not clearly require or permit a letter of credit or lease bond for lease security.\n\nDo not count (common false positives)\n- Do NOT treat the following as a Lease Bond:\n  - “Lien and completion bond” or similar bonds tied to tenant alterations/improvements (e.g., a 150% lien & completion bond for construction under an alterations clause).\n  - Surety bonds referenced for mechanics lien release, to cure defaults, or as generic “evidence of insurance or surety bond” unrelated to securing lease obligations or substituting the security deposit.\n  - Performance/payment bonds for construction, or any bond confined to construction or vendor obligations.\n- Do NOT treat standard insurance requirements (COI/evidence of insurance, business interruption, CGL, workers’ comp) as a bond or LOC.\n- Do NOT infer from security deposits alone; a cash security deposit by itself does not imply LOC or bond.\n\nConflict handling and multiple documents\n- If multiple documents are present, rely primarily on the lease (or amendments) for definitive security requirements.\n- If both a letter of credit and a lease bond are explicitly permitted/required for lease security, prefer “Letter of Credit”.\n- If the document set does not clearly indicate either instrument, output “None”.\n\nExamples mapped to these rules\n- If a lease states “Tenant shall deliver an irrevocable standby letter of credit in lieu of the security deposit,” output: Letter of Credit.\n- If a lease states “Landlord agrees to accept a surety (lease) bond securing all Tenant’s obligations under this Lease,” output: Lease Bond.\n- If a lease only lists a cash Security Deposit and elsewhere mentions a lien/completion bond for alterations or a surety bond to remove liens, output: None.\n- If a possession letter only discusses evidence of insurance and timing, with no LOC/lease-bond requirement, output: None.\n\nReminder\n- Output the single required value only: “Letter of Credit”, “Lease Bond”, or “None”.",
